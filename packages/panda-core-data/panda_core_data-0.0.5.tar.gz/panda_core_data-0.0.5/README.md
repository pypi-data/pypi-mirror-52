=========

So, if you already played games like Factorio, Rimworld or Dwarf Fortress and tried to mod them,
you will find that itâ€™s absurdly easy to mod those games for simple things like changing the
balancing, adding items, changing descriptions and etc. Because the data files of the games are
simple raws and not binaries. This library pretty much makes the task of using raws as simple as
possible. Raws in our case is plain text files like xml, json, yaml and etc that
is commonly used to hold data, for now the library supports `yaml` and `json`.

The library might have modding in mind, however it pretty much be used for any sort of software or
game engine that uses python.

Internally the library use [dataclasses](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html>) to
handle the data and [TinyDB](https://tinydb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to load them from raws.

Thanks for your interest in our package! But for now our things are still a bit of a todo. But, you
can check a basic api documentation here: https://pandacoredata.readthedocs.io/

# Install

This package only works with python 3.7 and above because it uses dataclasses.

The package is now available with pip, so to install all you need is to run this command:
```
pip install panda-core-data
```

# Quick Start

Once installed, you can run this command:
```
panda_core_data_commands.py -o directory-name
```
It will automatically generate the basic directory structure, plus a basic main file.
