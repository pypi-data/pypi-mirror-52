Description: # Nonsidereal Target Airmass TOM Module
        
        This module adds support to generate nonsidereal airmass plots
        to the TOM Toolkit.
        
        ## Installation:
        
        Install the module into your TOM environment:
        
            pip install tom-nonsidereal-airmass
        
        In your TOM's `settings.py`, add this to `INSTALLED_APPS`:
        
            ...
            'tom_nonsidereal_airmass',
        
        If you have already customized your `target_detail.html`
        template you can skip ahead to "At the top of the file."
        
        `cd` into the `templates` directory in the main directory of
        your project. Make a directory called `tom_targets` and `cd` into it.
        
        Now you need to find where pip installed the `tomtoolkit`
        in the virtual environment you use for your TOM. If you don't remember
        where that is, you can do
        
            pip show tomtoolkit
        
        and the `Location` will tell you where it is.
        Copy the following file into your `templates/tom_targets` dir:
        
            {tomtoolkit location}/tom_targets/templates/tom_targets/target_detail.html
        
        At the top of the file (I put it after the first `{% load %}`),
        paste the following line
        
            {% load nonsidereal_airmass_extras %}
        
        Then to actually display the plots, find the line that says
        
            {% elif target.type == 'NON_SIDEREAL' %}
        
        and delete the next line with the `<p>...</p>` about not being able to plot non-sidereal airmass.
        Change it to
        
            {% nonsidereal_target_plan %}
        
        And you're done!
