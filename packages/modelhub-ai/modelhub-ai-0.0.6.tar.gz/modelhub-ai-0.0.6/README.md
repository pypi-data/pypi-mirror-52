We are building a collection of deep learning models. Check it out [here](http://www.modelhub.ai).

Crowdsourced through contributions by the scientific research community, Modelhub is a repository of deep learning models pretrained for a wide variety of applications. Modelhub highlights recent trends in deep learning applications, enables transfer learning approaches and promotes reproducible science.

This repository is the index/registry of all models, and as such the point where all developments of the [Modelhub Project](https://github.com/modelhub-ai) come together.
