Description-Content-Type: text/markdown

This is a tool for labeling text documents.
Slate supports annotation at different scales (spans of characters, tokens, and lines, or a document) and of different types (free text, labels, and links).
This covers a range of tasks, such as Part-of-Speech tagging, Named Entity Recognition, Text Classification (including Sentiment Analysis), Discourse Structure, and more.

Why use this tool over the range of other text annotation tools out there?

- Fast
- Trivial installation
- Focuses all of the screen space on annotation (good for large fonts)
- Terminal based, so it works in constrained environments (e.g. only allowed ssh access to a machine)
- Not difficult to configure and modify

Note - this repository is **not** for the "Segment and Link-based Annotation Tool, Enhanced", which can be found [here](https://bitbucket.org/dainkaplan/slate/wiki/Home) and was first presented at [LREC 2010](http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2010/pdf/129_Paper.pdf).
See 'Citing' below for additional notes on that work.

## Installation

Two options:

### 1. Install with pip
```bash
pip install slate-nlp
```

Then run from any directory in one of two ways:
```
slate
python -m slate
```

### 2. Or download and run without installing
Either download as a zip file:
```bash
curl https://codeload.github.com/jkkummerfeld/slate/zip/master -o "slate.zip"
unzip slate.zip
cd slate-master
```
Or clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jkkummerfeld/slate
cd slate
```

Then run with either of:
```
python slate.py
./slate.py
```
To run from another directory, use:
```
python PATH_TO_SLATE/slate.py
PATH_TO_SLATE/slate.py
```

### Requirements

The code requires only Python (2 or 3) and can be run out of the box.
Your terminal must be at least 80 characters wide and 20 tall to use the tool.

While presenting this work at ACL I learned of another annotation tool called SLATE.
That tool was first described in "Annotation Process Management Revisited", [Kaplan et al. (LREC 2010)](http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2010/pdf/129_Paper.pdf) and then in "Slate - A Tool for Creating and Maintaining Annotated Corpora", [Kaplan et al. (JLCL 2011)](https://jlcl.org/content/2-allissues/12-Heft2-2011/11.pdf).
It takes a very different approach, using a web based interface that includes a suite of project management tools as well as annotation.
The code it available at [https://bitbucket.org/dainkaplan/slate/wiki/Home](https://bitbucket.org/dainkaplan/slate/wiki/Home).

## Getting Started

Note: if you used pip to install, reaplce `python slate.py` with `slate` everywhere below.

Run `python slate.py <filename>` to start annotating `<filename>` with labels over spans of tokens.
The entire interface is contained in your terminal, there is no GUI.
With command line arguments you can vary properties such as the type of annotation (labels or links) and scope of annotation (characters, tokens, lines, documents).

The input file should be plain text, organised however you like.
Prepare the data with your favourite sentence splitting and/or tokenisation software (e.g., [SpaCy](https://spacy.io)).
If you use Python 3 then unicode should be supported, but the code has not been tested extensively with non-English text (please share any issues!).

When you start the tool it displays a set of core commands by default.
These are also specified below, along with additional commands.

The tool saves annotations in a separate file (`<filename>.annotations` by default, this can be varied with a file list as described below).
Annotation files are formatted with one line per annotated item.
The item is specified with a tuple of numbers.
For labels, the item is followed by a hyphen and the list of labels.
For links, there are two items on the line before the hyphen.
For example, these are two annotation files, one for labels of token spans and the other for links between lines:

```
==> label.annotations <==
(2, 1) - label:a
((3, 5), (3, 8)) - label:a
(7, 8) - label:s label:a

==> link.annotations <==
13 0 - 
13 7 - 
16 7 - 
```

A few notes:
- The second label annotation is on a span of tokens, going from 5 to 8 on line 3.
- The third label annotation has two labels.
- The line annotations only have one number to specify the item.
- When the same line is linked to multiple other lines, each link is a separate item.

### Tutorials

Included in this repository are a set of interactive tutorials that teach you how to use the tool from within the tool itself.

Task | Command
---- | --------
Labelling spans of text in a document | `python slate.py tutorial/label.md -t categorical -s token -o -hh -l log.tutorial.label.txt`
Linking lines in a document | `python slate.py tutorial/link.md -t link -s line -o -hh -l log.tutorial.link.txt`
Comparing annotations | To be created

### Example Workflow

This tool has already been used for two annotation efforts involving multiple annotators ([Durrett et al., 2017](http://jkk.name/publication/emnlp17forums/) and [Kummerfeld et al., 2018](http://jkk.name/publication/arxiv18disentangle/)).
Our workflow was as follows:

- Create a repository containing (1) the annotation guide, (2) the data to be annotated divided into user-specific folders.
- Each annotator downloaded slate and used it to do their annotations and commit the files to the repository.
- Either the whole group or the project leader went through files that were annotated by multiple people, using the adjudication mode in the tool.

Note: special keys such as `ENTER` and `BACKSPACE` may not work on non-OS-X operating systems. That is why in all places where they are used we have an alternative as well.

### Misc

To annotate multiple files, specify more than one as an argument.
For greater control, provide a list of files in a file specified with `--data-list`.
The list should be formatted as follows, where [] indicate optional values:

```
raw_file [annotation_file [starting_position [additional_annotation_files]]]
```

For example, these commands will create a file list, use it, then return to it later:

```bash
find . -name *txt > filenames_todo
./slate.py -d filenames_todo -l do_later
# ... do some work, then quit, go away, come back...
./slate.py -d do_later.todo -l do_even_later -o
```

Note, the `-o` flag is added so it will allow you to edit the annotations you have already created.
Otherwise the system will complain that you are overwriting existing annotation files.

When the `additional_annotation_files` are included it activates an adjudication mode.
By default, all annotations that appear in all additional files are added to the current annotations.
Disagreements are coloured in the text, but will disappear once a decision is made (using the normal annotation commands).

Note - adjudication has not been as thoroughly tested.
Please share any issues you come across!

## Customisation

Colours and keys are customisable. For labelling, the default is:

 - Underlined, current selected item
 - Green on black, 'a' items
 - Blue on black, 's' items
 - Magenta on black, 'd' items
 - Red on black, 'v' items
 - Cyan on black, multiple types for a single token

For linking, the default is:

 - Underlined, current selected item
 - Green on black, current linking item
 - Blue on black, item is linked to the current linking item
 - Yellow on black, item is in some link, though not with the current linking item

### Modifying the Code

Slate has a relatively small codebase (~2,200 lines) and is designed to make adding new functionality not too hard.
The code is divided up as follows:

 - `annotate.py`, the main program, this has the core loop that gets user input.
 - `config.py`, contains the default configuration, including colours and keyboard bindings.
 - `data.py`, classes to read, store and write data.
 - `view.py`, rendering the screen.

Logic for determining what colour goes where is split across two parts of the code.
In `data.py`, the set of labels for an item is determined.
In `view.py`, that set of labels is used to choose a suitable colour.

Adding a new command involves:

 - Adding the name and key to `input_action_list` in `config.py`
 - Adding a mapping from the name to a function in `action_to_function` in `annotate.py`
 - Adding or modifying a function in `annotate.py`
 - Modifying `data.py` or `view.py` to apply the action
