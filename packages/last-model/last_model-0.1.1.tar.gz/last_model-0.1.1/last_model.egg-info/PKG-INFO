Description: # LAST-model
        
        ## older MATLAB & Python version
        
        The version used in the publication XXX, written in MATLAB, as well as its port to Python
        are currently kept in the example folder for reference. This Model is under heavy development
        and will substantially change in the future. The older code will, however, be kept, but 
        maybe moved to another location. This will be stated here, in case you have been redirected here
        from the aforementioned publication.
        
        ## LAST
        
        ### Install
        
        You can install LAST using pip:
        
        ```bash
        pip install last_model
        ```
        
        A more recent (and maybe more unstable) version might be available on Github.
        
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/KIT-HYD/last_model.git
        cd last_model
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        python setup.py install
        ```
        
        Using pip is the recommended way.
        
        ## Using LAST
        
        We will prepare a documentation soon. The Last model can be instantiated 
        using the `Last` class and executed using the `Last.run` method. 
        Model setup and model parameters are specified in a JSON file. A sample 
        test file is supplied with `last_model`.
        
        ```python
        from last_model import Last
        
        last = Last()
        last.run()
        ```
        
        ## Notes:
        
        * Last is slow at the moment. We are working on an improved performance
        * Last is undocumented. This will be changed.
        * Last is untested. We will provide unit tests with a future release
        * Last is pre-alpha. Interfaces and internal workflow will change substantially.
        * Last is not verbose, but it will learn speaking in a future release
