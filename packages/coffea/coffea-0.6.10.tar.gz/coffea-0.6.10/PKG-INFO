Description: .. inclusion-marker-1-5-do-not-remove
        
        coffea is currently organized into several sub-modules with specific purposes.
        
         
        1) analysis_objects - This package contains definitions of physics objects casted in the language of JaggedArrays
        
        2) arrays - Another take on making analysis objects with directly decorated LorentzVector objects instead of wrapped LorentzVectors.
        
        3) hist - A well-featured histogramming and plotting sub-package.
        
        4) jetmet_tools - CMS-specific tools for correcting Jets and Missing Energy
        
        5) lookup_tools - This package manages importing corrections and scale factors, and provides a unified interface for evaluating those corrections on physics objects.
        
        6) lumi tools - A CMS-specific package for parsing luminosity database files to derive integrated luminosity and good run lists.
        
        7) processor - An interface for defining and running analyses in a portable way across a variety of scale-out mechanisms.
        
        8) striped - This package defines transformations from the raw striped database into JaggedArrays and JaggedCandidateArrays, but is somewhat deprecated.

        Installation
        ============
        
        Install coffea like any other Python package:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            pip install coffea
        
        or similar (use ``sudo``, ``--user``, ``virtualenv``, or pip-in-conda if you wish).
        
        Strict dependencies:
        ====================
        
        - `Python <http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/>`__ (2.7+, 3.6+)
        
        The following are installed automatically when you install coffea with pip:
        
        - `numpy <https://scipy.org/install.html>`__ (1.15+)
        - `awkward-array <https://pypi.org/project/awkward>`__ to manipulate data from non-flat TTrees, such as jagged arrays (`part of Scikit-HEP <https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward-array>`__)
        - `uproot-methods <https://pypi.org/project/uproot-methods>`__ to allow expressions of things as lorentz vectors
        - `numba <https://numba.pydata.org/>`__ just-in-time compilation of python functions
        - ``scipy`` for statistical functions
        - ``matplitlib`` as a plotting backend
        - ``uproot`` for interacting with ROOT files
        - ``tqdm``
