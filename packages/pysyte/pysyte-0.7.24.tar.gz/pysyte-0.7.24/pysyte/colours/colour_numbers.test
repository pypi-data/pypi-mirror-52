The colour_numbers module
=========================

    >>> from pysyte.colours import colour_numbers
    >>> assert 'numbers known to represent colours' in  colour_numbers.__doc__

Convert html strings to integers
--------------------------------

A "web colour" is represented by a string with 3 hex values for R, G, B
    For example
    >>> html = '#00FF00'

Converting that to an integer and back gives itself
    >>> assert html == colour_numbers.integer_to_html(colour_numbers.html_to_int(html))

Same result if we start with slight variations on the string
    >>> assert html == colour_numbers.integer_to_html(colour_numbers.html_to_int(html.lower()))
    >>> assert html == colour_numbers.integer_to_html(colour_numbers.html_to_int(html.replace('#','0x')))

We can also use 3 single chars
    >>> assert html == colour_numbers.integer_to_html(colour_numbers.html_to_int('0x0F0'))

Any 3-char hex string is same as the 6-char version by just doubling the characters
    (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors#Shorthand_hexadecimal_form)
    >>> assert colour_numbers.html_to_int('0x09C') == colour_numbers.html_to_int('#0099cc')

Fixing HTML strings
-------------------

    >>> assert colour_numbers.html_to_html('f00') == 'FF0000'
    >>> assert colour_numbers.hashed_html('f00') == '#FF0000'

Converting html colours to ANSI colours
---------------------------------------

Convert an HTML colour string to an ANSI code (which is a number)
    (Test values here come from https://github.com/twoerner/xterm-256colour/blob/master/xtermcolours.sh)

    >>> html, ansi = '#875F5F', 95
    >>> assert colour_numbers.html_to_ansi(html) == ansi

And back again
    >>> # assert colour_numbers.ansi_to_html(ansi) == html

VGA colours
-----------

"Pure" colours have ANSI values less than 16 and come in "dark" and "light" shades
    These colours were used on very old terminals, back when I was a lad
    For example, blue:

Dark blue
    >>> assert colour_numbers.ansi_to_html(4) == '#000080'

Lighter blue:
    >>> assert colour_numbers.ansi_to_html(12) == '#0000FF'

Names to numbers
----------------

Recognises colour names from English, case-insensitively
    >>> assert colour_numbers.name_to_int('green') == 2 == colour_numbers.name_to_int('GREEN')

And other languages
    >>> assert colour_numbers.name_to_int('light red') == colour_numbers.name_to_int('f00')

Colour names are case-insensitive
    >>> assert colour_numbers.name_to_int('FF0000') == colour_numbers.name_to_int('f00')
