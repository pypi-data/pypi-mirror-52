**Requests III** is an HTTP library for Python, built for Humans and Machines, alike. **This repository is a work in progress, and the expected release timeline is "before PyCon 2020"**.

Behold, the power of Requests III:

```pycon
>>> from requests import HTTPSession

# Make a connection pool.
>>> http = HTTPSession()

# Make a request.
>>> r = http.request('get', 'https://httpbin.org/ip')

# View response data.
>>> r.json()
{'ip': '172.69.48.124'}
```

Requests III allows you to send *organic, grass-fed* **HTTP/1.1** & **HTTP/2** (wip) requests,
without the need for manual thought-labor. There's no need to add query
strings to your URLs, or to form-encode your POST data. Keep-alive and
HTTP connection pooling are 100% automatic, as well.

Besides, all the cool kids are doing it. Requests is one of the most
downloaded Python packages of all time, pulling in over ~1.6 million
installations *per day*!

Feature Support
---------------

Requests III is ready for today's web.

- Support for H11 & H2 protocols.
- Type-annotations for all public-facing APIs.
- Better defaults; required timeouts.
- ``async``/``await`` keyword & ``asyncio`` support.

-   Unicode Response Bodies
-   Multipart File Uploads
-   HTTP(S) Proxy Support
