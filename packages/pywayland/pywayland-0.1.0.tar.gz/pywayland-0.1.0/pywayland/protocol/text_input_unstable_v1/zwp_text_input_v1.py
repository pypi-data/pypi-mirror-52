class ZwpTextInputV1(Interface):
    """Text input

    An object used for text input. Adds support for text input and input
    methods to applications. A text_input object is created from a
    wl_text_input_manager and corresponds typically to a text entry in an
    application.

    Requests are used to activate/deactivate the text_input object and set
    state information like surrounding and selected text or the content type.
    The information about entered text is sent to the text_input object via the
    pre-edit and commit events. Using this interface removes the need for
    applications to directly process hardware key events and compose text out
    of them.

    Text is generally UTF-8 encoded, indices and lengths are in bytes.

    Serials are used to synchronize the state between the text input and an
    input method. New serials are sent by the text input in the commit_state
    request and are used by the input method to indicate the known text input
    state in events like preedit_string, commit_string, and keysym. The text
    input can then ignore events from the input method which are based on an
    outdated state (for example after a reset).

    Warning! The protocol described in this file is experimental and backward
    incompatible changes may be made. Backward compatible changes may be added
    together with the corresponding interface version bump. Backward
    incompatible changes are done by bumping the version number in the protocol
    and interface names and resetting the interface version. Once the protocol
    is to be declared stable, the 'z' prefix and the version number in the
    protocol and interface names are removed and the interface version number
    is reset.
