class ZwpInputMethodContextV1(Interface):
    """Input method context

    Corresponds to a text input on the input method side. An input method
    context is created on text input activation on the input method side. It
    allows receiving information about the text input from the application via
    events. Input method contexts do not keep state after deactivation and
    should be destroyed after deactivation is handled.

    Text is generally UTF-8 encoded, indices and lengths are in bytes.

    Serials are used to synchronize the state between the text input and an
    input method. New serials are sent by the text input in the commit_state
    request and are used by the input method to indicate the known text input
    state in events like preedit_string, commit_string, and keysym. The text
    input can then ignore events from the input method which are based on an
    outdated state (for example after a reset).

    Warning! The protocol described in this file is experimental and backward
    incompatible changes may be made. Backward compatible changes may be added
    together with the corresponding interface version bump. Backward
    incompatible changes are done by bumping the version number in the protocol
    and interface names and resetting the interface version. Once the protocol
    is to be declared stable, the 'z' prefix and the version number in the
    protocol and interface names are removed and the interface version number
    is reset.
