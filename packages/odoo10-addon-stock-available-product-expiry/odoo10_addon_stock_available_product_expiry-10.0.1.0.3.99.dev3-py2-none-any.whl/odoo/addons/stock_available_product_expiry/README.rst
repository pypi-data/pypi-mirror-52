Usage
=====

* Define a removal time on the product you want to manage expired stock
* Receive or inventory the product with a lot
* When the lot removal date is passed, the lot quantity is not taken into account in Quantity On Hand and the expired qty is displayed on the product (form view / kanban view)
* It is possible to deactivate temporarily the expired quantities by passing 'disable_check_expired_lots=True' to context
