Description: # RedSSH
        [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/redssh/badge/?version=latest)](https://redssh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)
        
        Connect to SSH servers in python easily and with C speed!
        Interacting with SSH shouldn't be hard, slow or limited to certain SSH severs.
        Based on ssh2-python (which provides libssh2 bindings for python) and made into an easy to use SSH library with the focus being ease of use and speed.
        SSH should be as easy as a pre-wrapped TLS TCP socket, it should work well, be fast in execution and be simple to interact with.
