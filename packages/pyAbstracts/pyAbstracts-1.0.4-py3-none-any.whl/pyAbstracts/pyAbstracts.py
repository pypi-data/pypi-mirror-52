# self.__gt__ causes problems when other and self are different types:
# other<self
# python does not have a __lt__ function for other which can accept an argument of type self
# so instead python assumes that as the relational operators for self have been overloaded
# they will be better suited to cope with occurance. Python trys to be clever by noticing that:
#
# other<self == ( ~self>other ^ ~self==other ) == ~(self>other V self==other)
# where:
# ~: not
# ^: and
# V: or
#
# however this just causes self.__gt__ to be called again and will cause a recursion loop
#
# SOLUTION
# the only way around this problem is to define all the comparision operators properly
# in every class

# see also reflected operators (magic methods) they exist for numeric operations
# the set of comparision operators make up their own reflected operations
# hence why they should all be defined.
