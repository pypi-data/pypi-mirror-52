Sardana is a Supervision, Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) system for
scientific installations. It is written in Python and based on the TANGO
library. The hardware control and data acquisition routines can be
accessed via an IPython console and a generic graphical user interface
(both of which are easily extensible by the user).
