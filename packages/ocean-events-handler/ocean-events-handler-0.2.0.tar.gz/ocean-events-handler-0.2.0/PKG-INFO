        # events-handler-py
        Publisher events handler agent dealing with Keeper Contract events
        
        
        ## Features
        
        
        ## Prerequisites
        
        Python 3.6
        
        ## Running Locally, for Dev and Test
        
        First, clone this repository:
        
        ```bash
        git clone git@github.com:oceanprotocol/events-handler-py.git
        cd events-handler-py/
        ```
        
        Start a keeper node and other services of the ocean network:
        
        ```bash
        git clone git@github.com:oceanprotocol/barge.git
        cd barge
        bash start_ocean.sh --no-events-handler --no-pleuston --local-spree-node
        ```
        
        Barge is the repository where all the Ocean Docker Compose files are located. 
        We are running the script `start_ocean.sh`: the easy way to have Ocean projects 
        up and running. We run without an events-handler instance because we will run it directly.
        
        To learn more about Barge, visit [the Barge repository](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/barge).
        
        Note that it runs an Aquarius instance and an Elasticsearch instance but Aquarius can 
        also work with BigchainDB or MongoDB.
        
        Export environment variables `PROVIDER_ADDRESS`, `PROVIDER_PASSWORD`
        and `PROVIDER_KEYFILE`. Use the values from the `tox.ini` file, or use 
        your own.
        
        The most simple way to start is:
        
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements_dev.txt
        export CONFIG_FILE=config.ini
        ./scripts/wait_for_migration_and_extract_keeper_artifacts.sh
        ./start_events_monitor.sh
        ```
         
        #### Code style
        
        The information about code style in python is documented in this two links [python-developer-guide](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/dev-ocean/blob/master/doc/development/python-developer-guide.md)
        and [python-style-guide](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/dev-ocean/blob/master/doc/development/python-style-guide.md).
        
        #### Testing
        
        Automatic tests are setup via Travis, executing `tox`.
        Our test use pytest framework.
