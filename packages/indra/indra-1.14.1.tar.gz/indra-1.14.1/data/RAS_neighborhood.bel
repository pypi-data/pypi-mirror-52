Since T-47D cells secrete VEGF87 it is likely that an autocrine VEGF loop exists within these cells. PI3-K activation has often been implicated in cellular invasion88 and may be the signalling mechanism in T-47D cells that mediates VEGF-induced cell invasion."

In another study, human osteosarcoma cells implanted in mice formed only microscopic avascular, dormant tumors, in which tumor cell proliferation was balanced by tumor cell apoptosis. When these cells were transfected with the ras oncogene, VEGF expression doubled, expression of thrombospondin decreased significantly, and large neovascularized tumors grew within approximately 2 weeks [7]. Thus, targeting oncogene products not only affects cancer cell proliferation and cell death, but also disrupts production of angiogenic factors. These studies predict that certain anti-cancer drugs developed for their capacity to block an oncogene product (for example, inhibitors of the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase), may have significant antiangiogenic activity [12,53,54]. For example, ras farnesyl transferase inhibitors block oncogene signaling pathways which up-regulate tumor cell production of VEGF and down-regulate production of the angiogenesis inhibitor, thrombospondin-1 [47]."

SET Evidence = "Advances in differentiation therapy of cancer are likely to depend on improved understanding of molecular events that underlie cell differentiation. We reported recently that cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk)5 and p35Nck5a (p35) are expressed in human leukemia HL60 cells induced to differentiate to monocytes by an exposure to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25D(3)), form a complex, and this complex has kinase activity (F. Chen and G. P. Studzinski, Blood 2001;97:3763). This laboratory has also provided evidence that the extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway is active in the early (24-48 h) stages of HL60 cell differentiation induced by 1,25D(3) but declines in the later, terminal phase of this form of differentiation (X. Wang and G. P. Studzinski, J Cell Biochem 2001;80:471). We examine now the hypothesis that Egr1 protein contributes to the up-regulation of p35 gene transcription and, thus, activated Cdk5/p35 kinase phosphorylates and inactivates mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase 1 (MEK1). Our data show that in 1,25D(3)-treated cells, p35 and Egr1 protein levels are elevated in a dose-dependent manner at the onset of the late stage of differentiation. We show also that 1,25D(3) treatment of HL60 cells markedly increases the binding of Egr1 to an element in the p35 gene promoter, whereas transfection of an excess of this Egr1-binding oligonucleotide ( promoter decoy ) reduces p35 gene transcription and cell differentiation. Additionally, Cdk5/p35 phosphorylates MEK1 and inhibits its ability to phosphorylate its downstream target Erk2. These data suggest that in 1,25D(3)-treated HL60 cells, Egr1 up-regulates p35 gene transcription and that Cdk5/p35 kinase inactivates the extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway by phosphorylation of MEK1, and this contributes to terminal differentiation of these cells. We examine now the hypothesis that Egr1 protein contributes to the up-regulation of p35 gene transcription and, thus, activated Cdk5/p35 kinase phosphorylates and inactivates mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase 1 (MEK1)."

Northern blot analysis revealed a   4.6-kb transcript that appears to be ubiquitously expressed. This protein directly regulates the stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) pathways by activating SEK and MEK1/2 respectively; it does not regulate the p38 pathway.

Among the 293 known genes regulated by taurine, a total of 44 genes were involved in signal transduction; 16 genes were up-regulated greater than 2.0-fold, and 28 genes were down-regulated more than 2.0-fold by taurine. The results of RT-PCR analyses for the five genes selected were consistent with our microarray data, although the fold changes in the expression level differed somewhat between the two analytical methods. Among signal transduction-related genes affected by taurine, four genes--mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase kinase 7, p21-activated kinase 4, sprouty homolog 2, and MAPK kinase 1--are implicated in the MAPK signaling pathway. Taurine also regulated the expression of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 gene involved in the Janus kinase-STAT pathway, and diacylglycerol kinase, zeta 104 kDa, the downstream mediator of the protein kinase C transmembrane signaling pathway. In conclusion, gene expression profiling of HepG2 cells treated with taurine provided us with new insights into the novel aspects of taurine as a possible regulator of MAPK signaling cascades and protein kinase C signaling pathways involved in cellular processes such as cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis."

We utilised a global proteomics phosphoantibody array approach to identify further c-MET/HGF signal transduction intermediates in SCLC. Strong HGF induction of specific phosphorylation sites in phosphoproteins involved in c-MET/HGF signal transduction was detected, namely adducin-alpha [S724], adducin-gamma [S662], CREB [S133], ERK1 [T185/Y187], ERK1/2 [T202/Y204], ERK2 [T185/Y187], MAPKK (MEK) 1/2 [S221/S225], MAPKK (MEK) 3/6 [S189/S207], RB [S612], RB1 [S780], JNK [T183/Y185], STAT3 [S727], focal adhesion kinase (FAK) [Y576/S722/S910], p38alpha-MAPK [T180/Y182], and AKT1[S473] and [T308]. Conversely, we also identified modest inhibition of phosphorylation by HGF in the following phosphoproteins (Figures 2A and B): PKCa [S657], PKCa/b [T368/641], and PKCd [T505]. Moreover, HGF also inhibited phosphorylation of PKR [T451], which is known to have antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic functions. Lastly, HGF also reduced the threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation of the cell cycle checkpoint regulator CDK1 [T14/Y15]."
