class IndraDBRestProcessor(object):
    """The packaging for query responses.

    Parameters
    ----------
    subject/object : str
        Optionally specify the subject and/or object of the statements in
        you wish to get from the database. By default, the namespace is assumed
        to be HGNC gene names, however you may specify another namespace by
        including `@<namespace>` at the end of the name string. For example, if
        you want to specify an agent by chebi, you could use `CHEBI:6801@CHEBI`,
        or if you wanted to use the HGNC id, you could use `6871@HGNC`.
    agents : list[str]
        A list of agents, specified in the same manner as subject and object,
        but without specifying their grammatical position.
    stmt_type : str
        Specify the types of interactions you are interested in, as indicated
        by the sub-classes of INDRA's Statements. This argument is *not* case
        sensitive. If the statement class given has sub-classes
        (e.g. RegulateAmount has IncreaseAmount and DecreaseAmount), then both
        the class itself, and its subclasses, will be queried, by default. If
        you do not want this behavior, set use_exact_type=True. Note that if
        max_stmts is set, it is possible only the exact statement type will
        be returned, as this is the first searched. The processor then cycles
        through the types, getting a page of results for each type and adding it
        to the quota, until the max number of statements is reached.
    use_exact_type : bool
        If stmt_type is given, and you only want to search for that specific
        statement type, set this to True. Default is False.
    persist : bool
        Default is True. When False, if a query comes back limited (not all
        results returned), just give up and pass along what was returned.
        Otherwise, make further queries to get the rest of the data (which may
        take some time).
    timeout : positive int or None
        If an int, block until the work is done and statements are retrieved, or
        until the timeout has expired, in which case the results so far will be
        returned in the response object, and further results will be added in
        a separate thread as they become available. If simple_response is True,
        all statements available will be returned. Otherwise (if None), block
        indefinitely until all statements are retrieved. Default is None.
    ev_limit : int or None
        Limit the amount of evidence returned per Statement. Default is 10.
    best_first : bool
        If True, the preassembled statements will be sorted by the amount of
        evidence they have, and those with the most evidence will be
        prioritized. When using `max_stmts`, this means you will get the "best"
        statements. If False, statements will be queried in arbitrary order.
    tries : int > 0
        Set the number of times to try the query. The database often caches
        results, so if a query times out the first time, trying again after a
        timeout will often succeed fast enough to avoid a timeout. This can also
        help gracefully handle an unreliable connection, if you're willing to
        wait. Default is 2.
    max_stmts : int or None
        Select the maximum number of statements to return. When set less than
        1000 the effect is much the same as setting persist to false, and will
        guarantee a faster response. Default is None.

    Attributes
    ----------
    statements : list[:py:class:`indra.statements.Statement`]
        A list of INDRA Statements that will be filled once all queries have
        been completed.
    statements_sample : list[:py:class:`indra.statements.Statement`]
        A list of the INDRA Statements received from the first query. In
        general these will be the "best" (currently this means they have the
        most evidence) Statements available.
