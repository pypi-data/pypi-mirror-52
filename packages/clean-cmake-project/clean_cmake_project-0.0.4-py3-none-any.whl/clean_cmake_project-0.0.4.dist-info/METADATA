# clean_cmake_project
python script to generate skeleton for cmake project for c++
https://github.com/FrenchCommando/clean_cmake_project

## Dependency
- python package stringcase - to convert name formats from/to pascal/snake/constant
- listed in requirement.txt
- python 3 - currently working with 3.7

## Usage
- directly use the script

or
- install the package and call a function
### Run the script - Old / Simple version
- Run the script in cmd
  - The script will prompt a name for the new sub_project
  - Enter the project name and hit Enter
  - You may also enter a path to another folder is you want to create the file in another folder
  (creates the folder if not exists), otherwise the files will be created in the current working directory and the name of the project is the base name of the current directory
  - (optional) If you also want to build an executable, you can specify a suffix for it (typically "run").

### using pip
- pip install clean_cmake_project
  - import clean_cmake_project.ProjectSkeleton as ccp
  - ccp(name, path)

  or
- installing the package also adds an entrypoint
  - cmake-python-project
  - that has the same effect as running the script

## Structure
- If not already present, a CMakeLists.txt file will be created and filled.
- googletest will be cloned in /libs/googletest
- source files are placed in the /src/ folder - with one sub-folder for each sub-project
- test files are placed in the /tests/ folder - with one sub-folder for each sub-project
- (optional) source files for executable in /src/*-exe_suffix/ folder

##Links
- The name of the main project is retrieve from the location of the script, it is used for
  - name of the project in the main CMakeList.txt
  - guards for .h files (#define CLEAN_CMAKE_PROJECT_TOTO_H)
- The main CMakeLists.txt contains links to
  - googletest directory
  - each src and tests sub-directories
- The CMakeLists.txt from the test folder has a link to the project defined in the src folder
  - the .cpp test contains and include to the .h in the src folder
