Description: # NOSpy - Official Python client for N.O.S.
        
        ## A brief introduction to N.O.S.
        
        N.O.S. is a fast Network Object Store that stores objects as binary data.
        The primary interface for NOS is HTTP/s.
        N.O.S. is written in GO, and is designed for high performance.
        This Python client aims to keep the objects as native as possible to python.
        It provides a thin layer of abstraction just to keep things pythonic, but
        the lower level HTTP api is always availble for you to use at your discretion.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Install NOSpy via pip:
        `pip install nospy`
        
        ## Setup & Usage
        
        In order to use NOSpy you'll need to have a working NOS server setup, running and accessible via HTTP.
        
        **NOTE:** NOS is not publicly available at the moment.
        
        Connect to the NOS server:
        
        ```python
        from nospy import NOSClient
        
        nos = NOSClient("http://localhost:9900")
        ```
