# corregraphe

Correlation graphs are a great way to visualize and understand the relationship between features of tabular datasets.

This package leverages NetworkX, Scipy and HoloViews to easily draw correlation graphs on any Pandas DataFrame.

Works on numerical columns only for now.

## Installation

This project uses Python >= 3.6.

```
pip install corregraphe
```

## Usage

Example on the Titanic dataset:

```python
import pandas as pd
from corregraphe import CorrelationGraph
df = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/titanic.csv")
cg = CorrelationGraph(df)
cg.draw()
```

Drawing gives this Bokeh figure:

## Developer's guide

- checked with `mypy` and `flake8`
- formatted with `black` and `isort`
- basic functionality is tested with `doctest` by running `python corregraphe/core.py`
