## PLEASE NOTE - breaking changes introduced in 1.0.0 release

Sometime during Spring 2019, Robinhood changed how their API handles
authentication. In order to adapt to those changes, I've moved
"authentication" outside this library to `fast_arrow_auth`,
https://github.com/westonplatter/fast_arrow_auth.

Please see:
- [issue 35](https://github.com/westonplatter/fast_arrow/issues/85) for a
detailed account of the issue
- [this comment](https://github.com/westonplatter/fast_arrow/issues/85#issuecomment-513834267) for the approach I've taken to remediate auth issues
- [this PR](https://github.com/westonplatter/fast_arrow/pull/94) for a run down on exact code changes

I have released these changes under version 1.0.0 to follow semantic
version guidelines (since auth changes are incompatible API changes).

## example

```py
from fast_arrow import Client, Stock, OptionChain, Option

#
# new auth process as of 1.0.0
# get auth_data (see https://github.com/westonplatter/fast_arrow_auth)
#
with open("fast_arrow_auth.json") as f:
    auth_data = json.loads(f.read())

#
# initialize client with auth_data
#
client = Client(auth_data)

#
# fetch the stock info for TLT
#
symbol = "TLT"
stock = Stock.fetch(client, symbol)

#
# get the TLT option chain
#
stock_id = stock["id"]
option_chain = OptionChain.fetch(client, stock_id)

#
# let's get TLT options (calls and puts) for next 4 expiration dates
#
oc_id = option_chain["id"]
eds = option_chain['expiration_dates'][0:3]

#
# get all options on the TLT option chain
#
ops = Option.in_chain(client, oc_id, expiration_dates=eds)

#
# merge in market data fro TLT option instruments (ask, bid, delta, theta, etc)
#
ops = Option.mergein_marketdata_list(client, ops)
```

## install

Install the package from pypi,
```
pip install fast_arrow
```

## design principles

You might be asking, "yet another Robinhood client? There's already a few out
there. What's different about this one?"

`fast_arrow` holds to these __design principles__,  
- focus on simple features that expose data. Don't interpret data.  
- make __stock__ & __option__ operations easy to reason through & execute with code  
- organize code in small and discrete python classes  
- use [fast_arrow_auth](https://github.com/westonplatter/fast_arrow_auth) to handle authentication process

## development
Install [pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv), and then run,
```
pipenv install --dev
```

Run the test suite via,
```
make test
```

Run all the examples (make sure you add username/password to config.debug.ini),
```
sh run_all_examples.sh
```

Run the test suite against a specific python version,
```
pipenv run tox -e py36
```

### releases

Adding so I don't forget the next time I release a version,
```
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
twine upload dist/*
```
