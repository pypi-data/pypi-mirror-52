Description: # Pynclose
        Python wrapper around the [In-Close algorithm implementation by Simon Andrews](https://sourceforge.net/projects/inclose/), Sheffield Hallam University, UK, Conceptual Structures Research Group.
        
        
        ## In-Close sources
        Version of 18/07/2017 retrieved from
        [the project page](https://sourceforge.net/projects/inclose/),
        and slightly changed to remove non-necessary parts (see 468fad66 and 04c00c47).
        
        ### Features
        - [X] make the sources really wrappable and usable as a lib, notability by crushing the main into a function with lots of parameters instead of waiting for them in the standard input.
        - [ ] fix the C global variable bug, as found by [run_test_dir/test_reusability_of_search.py](run_test_dir/test_reusability_of_search.py)
        - [ ] Unit tests.
        - [ ] Better file path management (python side, probably).
        - [ ] Packaging is currently a mess ; notabily becauses C package is not properly integrated into the package itself. Compilation may or may not be working when installing from pypi.
