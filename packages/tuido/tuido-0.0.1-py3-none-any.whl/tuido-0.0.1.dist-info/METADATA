Tuido
======

Simple todo list implementation using python [curses](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/curses.html).

## Description

This actually turned out to be a little more comprehensive than I had originally intended; features include:

 - Subtasks to any depth
 - Marking done
 - Marking for deletion
 - Permanent deletion
 - Scrolling long lists
 - Configuration spacing, indenting etc
 - A vim-styled command line interface

## Usage

All the functionality of `tuido` is provided through single character commands, these are:

    Todo List: top level

        a  :  Add item to current level
        A  :  Add subtask to highlighted item
        c  :  Edit description (^H to backspace)
        C  :  Change description
        d  :  Mark deleted
        D  :  Delete (permanent)
        h  :  Up level
        j  :  Down
        k  :  Up
        l  :  Down level
        m  :  Mark done
        M  :  Mark done (recursive)
        q  :  Write and quit
        r  :  Refresh screen
        w  :  Write
        ?  :  Show (this) help screen
        :  :  Enter command

### Command Line

The command line interface is quite simple, hit '`:`' and give a character command, followed by a description is relevant, then a sequence of numbers indicating the (sub)task to change, e.g:

    : A "New Task" 1 2 4

This will add a task witht he description "New Task" to subsubtask 4 of subtask 2 of task 1 of the current window/level.

## Todo

There still are a couple of things I'd like to add, these include:

 - A searching mechanism
 - Tags probably through the `@` symbol
 - Configurable colors
