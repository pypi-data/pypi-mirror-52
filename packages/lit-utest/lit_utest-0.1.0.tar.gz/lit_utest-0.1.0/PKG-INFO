Description: lit_utest
        =========
        
        llvm-lit module for first-class utest.h unit test support
        
        This module allows you to run a utest testsuite as part of a larger ``lit``
        testsuite. This is useful when you want to mix API unit tests with functional
        testing of your driver programs.
        
        Usage
        -----
        In each of your main utest test files, set the build command::
        
           // UTEST_BUILD: cc %s -o %utest_bin
        
        This works like the built-in ``ShTest``, but introduces the special
        ``UTEST_BUILD`` keyword to lit. The runner executes this command and the runs
        the resulting ``%utest_bin`` with ``--filter`` for each of the tests printed by
        ``--list-tests``. It collects the results and prints them in the way you'd
        expect ``lit`` to do.
        
        Then configure lit with the ``UTestRunner`` in lit.local.cfg::
        
           import lit_utest
           config.test_format = lit_utest.UTestRunner()
        
        For examples, see the ``test`` directory, where we eat our own dogfood.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        ``pip install lit_utest``
        
        Requirements
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^
        ``lit`` is required. Your tests should be `utest.h`-based or behave like it.
        
        Compatibility
        -------------
        This module *should* work in all places upstream lit is supported, but I will
        make no effort to support python < 2.7
        
        Licence
        -------
        utest.h is Public Domain, llvm is either NCSA or Apache-2 license depending on
        the version, so it makes sense to go PUBLIC DOMAIN.
