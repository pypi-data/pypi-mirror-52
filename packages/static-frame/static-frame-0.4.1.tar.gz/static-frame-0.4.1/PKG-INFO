Description: The StaticFrame library consists of the Series and Frame, immutable data structures for one- and two-dimensional calculations with self-aligning, labelled axes. StaticFrame meets the need for an immutable Pandas DataFrame with a consistent, functional interface. While many interfaces are similar to Pandas, StaticFrame deviates from Pandas in many ways: all data is immutable, and indices are always unique; the full range of NumPy data types is preserved, and date-time indices use discrete NumPy types; hierarchical indices are seamlessly integrated; and flexible approaches to element, row, and column iteration and function application are provided in a uniform interface.
