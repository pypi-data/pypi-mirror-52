# FOCUS TOOLS
Python utilities supporting the FOCUS package and cryo-EM data processing in general.

FOCUS TOOLS offers Python functions and scripts for performing common tasks in cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) data processing such as postprocessing 3D maps, filtering, masking, computing FSC curves, cropping/padding in real and Fourier space, CTF correction, among others. Some of the tools contained here were developed to support the FOCUS package.

The I/O of MRC files is based on the [MRCZ library](https://github.com/em-MRCZ/python-mrcz).

Where possible, tasks are accelerated by the [NumExpr](https://github.com/pydata/numexpr) engine.

## Installation
FOCUS TOOLS can be installed from [PyPI](http://pypi.org) using `pip`:

`sudo pip install focustools`

If not using `sudo`, it will be installed locally in the user `HOME`. In this case, make sure you have the following location in your `PATH` environment variable:
`~/.local/bin/`
