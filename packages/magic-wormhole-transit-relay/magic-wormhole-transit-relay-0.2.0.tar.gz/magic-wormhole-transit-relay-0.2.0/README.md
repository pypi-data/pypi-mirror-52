Transit Relay server for Magic-Wormhole

This repository implements the Magic-Wormhole "Transit Relay", a server that
helps clients establish bulk-data transit connections even when both are
behind NAT boxes. Each side makes a TCP connection to this server and
presents a handshake. Two connections with identical handshakes are glued
together, allowing them to pretend they have a direct connection.

This server used to be included in the magic-wormhole repository, but was
split out into a separate repo to aid deployment and development.

See docs/running.md for instructions to launch the server.
