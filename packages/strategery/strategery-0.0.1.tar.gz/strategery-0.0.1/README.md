## About
The Feature Engine is an approach to structuring code, inspired by the spaghetti-ass feature extraction tasks I've done for machine learning. I'm no expert in design patterns, but I think it's somewhere between [chain-of-responsibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain-of-responsibility_pattern) and [strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern).

The concept is that you're trying to build a feature vector, and in the process, you have all these functions you want to apply to a common source of information. You find yourself using the same algorithms in a bunch of scripts, but sometimes just some of them, and sometimes in a different order, and sometimes you want to discard interstitial data. Sometimes you perform an expensive calculation in the middle, but you want to share that result between other functions.

For a toy example, let's say you have an input type of ParamListOfNumbers. Let's define a class for it. We don't even need anything in the class, the structure is just a clue to the engine so it can find the data later.

```python
class ParamListOfNumbers(list):
    '''Dummy class that is a key for input parameters'''
    pass
```
And the features you're extracting are a Minimum, Mean, and AbsoluteValueMinimum.

```python
from strategery import fed_by

@fed_by(ParamListOfNumbers)
def Minimum(numbers):
    ''' The least '''
    return min(numbers)


@fed_by(ParamListOfNumbers)
def Mean(numbers):
    ''' AKA Average '''
    return 1.0 * sum(numbers) / len(numbers)


@fed_by(Minimum)
def AbsoluteValueMinimum(minimum):
    ''' A highly contrived task for example purposes '''
    return abs(minimum)
```

Hold up, `@fed_by()`?

OK, so `@fed_by()` is a decorator that will mark up your tasks so it can tell the engine what its own dependencies are. Then the engine can calculate a strategery for how to get to the results you requested, and if you provided all the necessary components, it resolve all the dependencies and hand off values between your functions.

All right, that's it for setup. Let's crunch some numbers. When you're calling `strategery.execute`, the `targets` parameter is a list of the results you want, and the `preprocessed` parameter lets you provide information for the engine to start with.

```python
import strategery
import sys

# Enable verbose logging:
strategery.engine.logger = sys.stdout

# Provide a list of numbers, get AbsoluteValueMinimum, let strategery figure out the rest.
mean, absolute_value_minimum = strategery.execute(
        targets=[
            Mean,
            AbsoluteValueMinimum
        ],
        preprocessed={
            ParamListOfNumbers: [-1, -2, -3, -4, -5]
        }
    )

# Disable verbose logging:
strategery.engine.logger = strategery.logging.BypassLogger()

print("")
print('Input: [-1, -2, -3, -4, -5]')
print(f'Mean: {mean}')
print(f'AbsoluteValueMinimum: {absolute_value_minimum}')

```
