        -------------------------------------------------
        A library of utilities for working with Extender.
        -------------------------------------------------
        
        The ``extools`` package provides a number of functions and classes
        to make it easier to write clear, concise, Python code when writing
        scripts and modules for Python Extender.
        
        Installation
        ************
        
        To be available from Extender scripts, the ``extools`` package must be
        installed in the embedded Extender Python environment.  This is not 
        trivial.  
        
        The use of the `Python Package Manager for Orchid Extender`_ is recommended.
