Description: 
        Guppy 3 is a library and programming environment for Python,
        currently providing in particular the Heapy subsystem, which supports
        object and heap memory sizing, profiling and debugging. It also
        includes a prototypical specification language, the Guppy
        Specification Language (GSL), which can be used to formally specify
        aspects of Python programs and generate tests and documentation from a
        common source.
        
        Guppy 3 is a fork of Guppy-PE, created by Sverker Nilsson for Python 2.
        
        The guppy top-level package contains the following subpackages:
        
        etc
               Support modules. Contains especially the Glue protocol module.
        
        gsl
               The Guppy Specification Language implementation. This can
               be used to create documents and tests from a common source.
        
        heapy
               The heap analysis toolset. It can be used to find information
               about the objects in the heap and display the information
               in various ways.
        
        sets
               Bitsets and 'nodesets' implemented in C.
