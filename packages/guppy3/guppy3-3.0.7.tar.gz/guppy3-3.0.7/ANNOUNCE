I am happy to announce Guppy 3 3.0.7

Guppy 3 is a library and programming environment for Python,
currently providing in particular the Heapy subsystem, which supports
object and heap memory sizing, profiling and debugging. It also
includes a prototypical specification language, the Guppy
Specification Language (GSL), which can be used to formally specify
aspects of Python programs and generate tests and documentation from a
common source.

Guppy 3 is a fork of Guppy-PE, created by Sverker Nilsson for Python 2.

The main news in this release:

o Disabled malloc hooks because of thread safety issues
o Optimizations to the dictof classifier by using GC objects
o No more stack overflows during heap traversal
o Tab completion with rlcompleter on a UniSet is no longer so expensive
