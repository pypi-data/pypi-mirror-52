    In this monitor, a time series is a set of data points and time intervals of
    fixed duration. A data point records data measured at that exact point in time
    and the subsequent interval.
    
    This monitor handles the following types of recorded measurements in data
    points: "counter", "gauge" and "absolute". For more information on these
    types, see their class documentation. 

    If no measurement is recorded for a given data point, the data point will not
    be stored in the time series. Consumers of the time series should perform
    interpolation if required (e.g. for graphic representation).

    The simple monitor contains a `series` instance variable, which is a
