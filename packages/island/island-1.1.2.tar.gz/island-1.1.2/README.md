Island
=======

`island` is a generic source downloader and syncronizer is a FREE software tool.

It is compatible with basic format of repo-git manifest. This project is created to be easyest to read with simple interface
(no internal git usage, but user level git usage) The main point to create the "fork" is the non-support of repo of relativity
in submodule of git (submodule reference with ../xxx.git) This point is really important when you want to have a rellocable
manifest and project with submodule. The simpl eexample is the atria-soft / generic-library / musicdsp that are availlable on
github, gitlab, bitbucket and personal server.
