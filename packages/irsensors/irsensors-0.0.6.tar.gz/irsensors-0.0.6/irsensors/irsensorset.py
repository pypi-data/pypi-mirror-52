	This class is a thread, it means that the run method will be executed in parallel to the main program as soon as the start method is call in the main program.

	Attributes:
		THREAD_ATTRIBUTES is a tuple of attribute's name that need to be modifie for the thread to run well.
		_sensor is the serial connection USB with the physical sensor.
		_sensors is the list of IR sensor contents in the physical sensor.
		_listening is the control variable for knowing if the thread is launched or not.

		main method :
			listen(self) :
				This method is call by the run method, itself called by the start method as explain before. The user needs to launche the start method to access sensor's data.
				This method reads data from the physical sensor throught the _sensor attribute. After a little process on the data, give it to the right IRSensor in the attribute _sensors list.

		other methods :
			__len__(self): Give the number of sensor in the sensor set.
			run(self):
				This method is executed in parallel to the main programm as soon as the main program call the start method.
				Firstly, check if the thread is not already launched, then update the _listening attribute, open the serial connection, write '1' for the physical sensor to start sending data and launche the listen method in a while loop as long as the _listening attribute is True.
				Finally, when the _listening attribute changes from True to False, stop to launche the listen method, write '0' for the physical sensor to stop sending data and close the serial connection USB.
			stop(self): Change the _listening attribute's value from True to False to stop the loop in the run method.
			__repr__(self): Return a str which indicates the class of the object and the value of his attributes.
			__str__(self): Return a str which indicates the distance of each IRSensor in the _sensor list, in the same order as their ID was given in the constructor.
