brendapy: BRENDA in python
====================================

The ``brendapy`` package provides a python parser for
`BRENDA <https://www.brenda-enzymes.org/index.php>`__
enzyme information. The parser extracts the protein information from the
database flat file and makes it accessible in a simple manner.

This package was developed in the context of building kinetic pathway models
with source code at https://github.com/matthiaskoenig/brendapy

``brendapy`` support has been tested on ``py36`` and ``py37``.

If you use this package cite `BRENDA <https://www.brenda-enzymes.org/index.php>`__
