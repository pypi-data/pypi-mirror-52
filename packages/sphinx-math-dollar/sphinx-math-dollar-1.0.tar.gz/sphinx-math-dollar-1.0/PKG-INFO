Description: ====================
         sphinx-math-dollar
        ====================
        
        sphinx-math-dollar is a Sphinx extension to let you write LaTeX math using $$.
        
        To enable install it
        
        .. code::
        
           pip install sphinx-math-dollar
        
        or
        
        .. code::
        
           conda install sphinx-math-dollar
        
        Then in your ``conf.py``, add ``'sphinx_math_dollar'`` to your extensions list:
        
        .. code:: python
        
           extensions = ['sphinx_math_dollar', 'sphinx.ext.mathjax']
        
        You will now be able to use dollar signs for math, like ``$\int\sin(x)\,dx$``,
        which will produce $\int\sin(x)\,dx$ (if you are reading this on GitHub, look
        at the version built by Sphinx `here
        <https://www.sympy.org/sphinx-math-dollar/>`_). The usual Sphinx ``:math:``
        directive will also continue to work.
        
        The extension will also work with docstrings when combined with the
        `sphinx.ext.autodoc
        <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autodoc.html>`_
        extension.
