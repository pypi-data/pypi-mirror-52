        **A Jupyter Notebook workflow for grading exams at the Hochschule Bonn-Rhein-Sieg** for everyone who hates spreadsheets as much as I do.
        
        This workflow allows you to
         - import a csv-file (e.g. obtained from DIAS), 
         - enter points for each student for an exam consisting of a specified number of assignments, 
         - decide on a passing grade and the limit of a *"perfect"* grade and 
         - create publishable results with some additional exam statistics.
        
        Check out [this example notebook](hbrs_grader/template/template.ipynb). 
        The [exported HTML-document](https://gitlab.com/joergbrech/hbrs_grader/-/jobs/artifacts/master/download?job=test) will not contain the code cells. 
        
        
        Since the export format is HTML and most online teaching tools such as MOODLE or ILIAS support HTML, you can simply copy the HTML source to a text node of your online course.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Run 
        
        ```bash
        pip install hbrs_grader
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        ### Step 1/3: Create a Notebook from template
        
        Run 
        
        ```bash
        hbrs-grader create 2019_MyExam
        ```
        
        to create a Jupyter notebook called `2010_MyExam.ipynb` in your current working directory.
        
        ### Step 2/3: Grade your exam
        
        Execute the newly created notebook using `jupyter-notebook` or `jupyter-lab`:
        
        ```bash
        jupyter-notebook ./2019_MyExam.ipynb
        ```
        
        Then just follow the instructions in the code comments. You can add additional code cells if you like, just make sure that all code cells contain the following metadata
        
        ```json
        {
            "hideCode": true,
            "hidePrompt": true
        }
        ```
        
        so that they don't show up in the published html.
        
        ### Step 3/3: Publish the results
        
        Once you are done grading, you can export the notebook to HTML with the following command:
        
        ```bash
        hbrs-grader export-notebook 2019_MyExam.ipynb
        ```
