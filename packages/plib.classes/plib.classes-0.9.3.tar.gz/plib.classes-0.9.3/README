**README** for PLIB.CLASSES 0.9.3

:Author:        Peter A. Donis
:Release Date:  21 Sep 2019

The PLIB.CLASSES package contains a number of useful
Python classes.

Note: PLIB.CLASSES works with Python 2.7. If you are using
Python 3, see the PLIB3.CLASSES package, available at
https://pypi.org/project/plib3.classes.

The ``setup.py`` script for PLIB.CLASSES uses the ``setuputils``
helper module, which helps to automate away much of the
boilerplate in Python setup scripts. This module is available
as a separate release at https://pypi.org/project/setuputils.

The PLIB.CLASSES Package
------------------------

The following classes are available in the ``plib.classes`` namespace:

- The ``StateMachine`` class implements a basic finite state machine
  with customizable code to be run at each state transition.

Installation
------------

To install PLIB.CLASSES, you can simply run::

    $ python setup.py install

at a shell prompt from the directory into which you
unzipped the source tarball (the same directory that this
README file is in). This will install PLIB and then
run each of the post-install scripts in the scripts
directory.

The Zen of PLIB
---------------

There is no single unifying purpose or theme to PLIB, but
like Python itself, it does have a 'Zen' of sorts:

- Express everything possible in terms of built-in Python
  data structures.

- Once you've expressed it that way, what the code is
  going to do with it should be obvious.

- Avoid boilerplate code, *and* boilerplate data. Every
  piece of data your program needs should have one and
  only one source.
