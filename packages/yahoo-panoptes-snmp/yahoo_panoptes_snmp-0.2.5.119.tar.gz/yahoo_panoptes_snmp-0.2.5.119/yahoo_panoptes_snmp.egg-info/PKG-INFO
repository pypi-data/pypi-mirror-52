        ## Introduction
        
        This library, which is a fork of the excellent [EasySNMP library](https://github.com/kamakazikamikaze/easysnmp), provides a Pythonic wrapper
        on top of [Net-SNMP](http://www.net-snmp.org) C library. 
        
        
        ## Background
        
        The key differences from the upstream library are:
        
        - Includes Net-SNMP source code which is used to build shared objects during installation leading to self contained distributions
        - Locks down options for the Net-SNMP library: for example, SNMPv1 is and applications are disabled
        - No MIBs are include in the distribution - this is by design since using symbolic OIDs is slow
        - A Python based implementation of bulk_walk
        - Fix support for tunneled SNMP connections
        
        ## Install
        
        Install by running the following commands:
        
        ```
        pip install yahoo_panoptes_snmp
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        The API is similar to that of EasySNMP, which is [documented here](https://easysnmp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/session_api.html)
        
        ### bulk_walk
        
        The implementation of BULKWALK is based on doing BULKGETs and using 'falling out' of the OID tree to terminate.
        
        The method signature is as follows:
        
        ```python
        def bulk_walk(self, oids, non_repeaters=0, max_repetitions=10):
            """
            Performs a series of bulk SNMP GET operation using the prepared session to
            retrieve multiple pieces of information in a single packet.
        
            :param oids: you may pass in a list of OIDs or single item; each item
                         may be a string representing the entire OID
                         (e.g. 'sysDescr.0') or may be a tuple containing the
                         name as its first item and index as its second
                         (e.g. ('sysDescr', 0))
            :param non_repeaters: the number of objects that are only expected to
                                  return a single GETNEXT instance, not multiple
                                  instances
            :param max_repetitions: the number of objects that should be returned
                                    for all the repeating OIDs
            :return: a list of SNMPVariable objects containing the values that
                     were retrieved via SNMP
            """
        ```
