Description: This is rwrlock a yet another python re-entrant rw lock
        
        Goals
        * To make a rentrant read write ock as opposed to non re-entrant
        * Within one thread multiple readlocks can be obtained in reality only first in stack takes lock restreference count
        * Within onethreadmultiple write locks can be obtained again first gets lock restreference count
        * Withion one thread if you want a readlock and have a write lock it acts as if read lock is obtained but keeps the write lock
        * What this does not do is promote a read lock to a write lock that instead throws a runtime error
        
        This does not implement and priority between readers and writers
          
        ```
        Usage:
                    from rwrlock import RWRLock
                    
                    my_obj_rwlock = RWRLock()
                    
                    # When reading from my_obj:
                    with my_obj_rwlock.r_locked():
                        do_read_only_things_with(my_obj)
                        
                    # When writing to my_obj:
                    with my_obj_rwlock.w_locked():
                        mutate(my_obj)
        
        ```
