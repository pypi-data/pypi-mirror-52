        **Vivid Code** is a pioneering software framework for next generation data
        analysis applications, that interconnects collaborative data science with
        automated machine learning.
        
        Based on the **Cloud-Assisted Meta programming** (CAMP) paradigm, the framework
        allows the usage of **Currently Best Fitting** (CBF) algorithms. Before code
        interpretation / compilation the concrete algorithms, that implement the CBF
        specifications, are automatically chosen from local and public catalog servers,
        that host and deploy the concrete algorithms. Thereby the specification is
        constituted by a unique algorithm category, a data domain and a metric, which
        substantiates the meaning of *Best Fitting* within the respective algorithm- and
        data context. An example is the average prediction accuracy within a fixed set
        of gold standard samples of the data domain (e.g. latin handwriting samples,
        spoken word samples, TCGA gene expression data, etc.).
        
        The Vivid Code framework allows the implementation of cutting edge enterprise
        analytical applications, that are automatically kept up-to-date and therefore
        **minimize their maintenance costs**. Also the Vivid Code framework facilitates
        the publication, application, sharing and comparison of algorithms, within and
        between workgroups.
        
        All components of the Vivid Code framework are open source and based on the
        [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language.
        
        Current Development Status
        --------------------------
        
        The individual components of the Vivid Code frame work are in different
        development stages.
        Rian currently is in *Pre-Alpha* development stage, which immediately follows
        the *Planning* stage. This means, that at least some essential requirements of
        Rian are not yet implemented.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Comprehensive information and installation support is provided within the
        [online manual](http://docs.frootlab.org/vivid). If you already have a
        Python environment configured on your computer, you can install the latest
        distributed version by using pip:
        
            $ pip install vivid
        
        Documentation
        -------------
        
        The documentation of the latest distributed version is available as an [online
        manual](http://docs.frootlab.org/vivid) and for download, given in the
        formats [PDF](https://readthedocs.org/projects/vivid/downloads/pdf/latest/),
        [EPUB](https://readthedocs.org/projects/vivid/downloads/epub/latest/) and
        [HTML](https://readthedocs.org/projects/vivid/downloads/htmlzip/latest/).
