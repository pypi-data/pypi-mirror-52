Simulus implements a process-oriented simulation world-view with several advanced features to ease modeling and simulation tasks with both events and processes.  Simulus also supports parallel and distributed simulation (since version 1.2). We will soon add support for real-time simulation (planned for version 1.3).\n",

    "Simulus should run with Python version 2.8 and above. If your python is too old, you should consider updating your Python as well as `pip` (Pythonâ€™s package manager).\n",
    "\n",
    "You should be able to install simulus with `pip`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install simulus\n",
    "```\n",

    "This will install simulus system-wide for all users (assuming you have the necessary privilege on your machine). The installation will also automatically include all Python packages needed by simulus.\n",

    "You can also install simulus for just yourself, using:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install --user simulus\n",

   "source": [
    "We show the basic use of simulus in the following. The purpose here is show some of the basic capabilities of simulus. For more detailed explanation and to learn to use simulus, you should check out the simulus tutorial mentioned above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simulus can work in two ways. One way is through events. The user schedules events. Simulus makes sure all events are sorted in timestamp order. When an event happens, simulus advances the simulation time to the event and calls the event handler, which is just a user-defined function. While processing the event, the user can schedule new events into the simulated future. We call this approach *direct event scheduling*. \n",
    "\n",
    "The other way is through processes. The user can create processes and have them run and interact. Each process is a separate thread of control. During its execution, a process may be suspended, by either sleeping for some time or getting blocked when requesting for some resources currently unavailable. The process resumes execution when the specified time has passed or after the resource blocking conditions have been removed. We call this approach *process scheduling*. \n",
    "\n",
    "In simulus, both direct event scheduling and process scheduling can be used together seamlessly to achieve the modeling tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is a hello-world example, which simply schedules a function (a.k.a. an event handler) to be invoked in the simulated future. Inside the function, the user schedules the same function again."
