    "# Queuing Models\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial describes how to use simulus to simulate queuing models. Simulus aspires to be a part of the Python ecosystem supporting scientific computing. This tutorial consists of several Jupyter notebooks, on which we run the simulation code. \n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial requires the following Python packages:\n",
    "* **jupyter**: a web application for sharing interactive documents that contain text, code, and data visualization\n",
    "* **numpy**: a library for efficient representation of multi-dimensional arrays\n",
    "* **scipy**: a library for numerical computations, including linear algebra and statistics\n",
    "* **matplotlib**: a 2D plotting library\n",
    "\n",
    "You can install these packages via commands such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "python -m pip install --user jupyter numpy scipy matplotlib\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, you'll need to install simulus too. Check out [Quick Start](https://simulus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readme.html) for simulus installation instructions. Basically, you can install simulus via commands such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "python -m pip install --user simulus\n",
