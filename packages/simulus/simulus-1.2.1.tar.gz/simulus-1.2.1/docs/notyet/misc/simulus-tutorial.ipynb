    "# Simulus Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial describes the basic functions of simulus. You should be able to find all examples shown in this tutorial under the `examples` directory in the simulus source-code distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.  What's Simulus?\n",
    "\n",
    "Simulus is a process-oriented discrete-event simulator written in Python. That's quite a mouthful. Let's first break it down what that really means. \n",
    "\n",
    "A discrete-event simulator models the world as a sequence of events that happen in discrete time. The simulator basically processes these events in order. Such a simulator would keep a simulation clock, which advances its time (by leaps and bounds) in accordance with the time of the events being processed along the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a professor starts the day with a cup of coffee at 4 AM, reads for 2 hours, has breakfast, takes shower, and then drives to school at 7:30 AM. The discrete-event simulator for the professor's day will go through a sequence of events: a \"wake up\" event at 4:00, a \"start coffee\" event at 4:05, a \"start read\" event at 4:10, a \"finish coffee\" event at 4:20, a \"finish read\" event at 6:10, a \"breakfast\" event at 6:30, a \"shower\" event at 6:50, a \"start driving\" event at 7:30, so on and so forth. The clock of the simulator in this case will go through a sequence of increasing values: 4:00, 4:05, 4:10, ... You get the gist. \n",
    "\n",
    "Discrete-event simulation is a very powerful modeling method. You can think of the entire world, including the activities of the professors, the students, and all other people, as a sequence of events that happen over time. The simulator's job is to \"play out\" the events in order. By doing so, we hopefully get better understanding of the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simulus is a \"process-oriented\" discrete-event simulator. What it means is that in addition to describing the world as a sequence of events, one can also model it using processes. As an example, suppose the world consists of many professors, students, and people. Previously we described the schedule of one professor. A different person would have a different schedule and follow a different sequence of events. Using process-oriented simulation, every person in this system can be modeled as a separate process or processes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that people interact in this world. For example, if everyone starts driving to school or to work in the morning at the same hour, most may get delayed since congestion would happen on the road. Also, if a student needs to meet with another student at a coffee shop. They would not be able to carry on with their next task (say, to work on their joint project) until both of them are present in the coffee shop. Simulus provides the needed support for creating and managing the processes, and having them coordinate with one another, so as to make it easier for you to model the complexed interactions and procedures in this world.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.  How Does It Work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Simulus works in two ways. One way is through events. You can schedule events and process them. We call it *direct event scheduling*. The other way is through processes. You can create processes and have them run and interact. We call it *process scheduling*. Of course, there's a third way, by combining them and having both event schedule and process scheduling in the models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1  Direct Event Scheduling\n",
    "\n",
    "In simulus, an event is simply a function to be invoked at a designated time. This can be illustrated using the following hello-world example.\n",

    "In order to use the simulator, we need to first import the `simulus` package and then create a simulator using the `simulator()` function. A simulator maintains an event list where all events will be sorted in their timestamp order. A simulator also keeps the current simulation time, which gets advanced while executing the events on the event list. One can find out the current time of the simulator by inspecting the `now` variable of the simulator.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example, the function `print_message()` is scheduled to run at time 10. We schedule the function using the `sched()` method of the simulator, and passing the name of the function with the `until` argument to specify the time at which the function should be invoked. In discrete-event simulation terminology, the `print_message()` function is also called an *event handler*. In simulus, an event handler can be any Python function or method.\n",
    "\n",

    "In the previous hello-world example, we did not pass any arguments to the `print_params()` function. The `sim` variable is module scoped. That is, as long as the function stays in the same module where `sim` is defined, it'll be fine. But this would not work in a more complicated scenario, e.g., when we develop a model that spreads into multiple python modules, or when the functions need paramesters.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we schedule three functions: `print_params_1()` at time 10, `print_params_1()` at time 20, and `print_params_3()` at both time 30 and time 40. We can pass aguments from `sched()` to an event handler by placing the arguments right after the function name (the first argument of `sched()`). Here we take advantage of Python's ability to take both positional arguments and keyworded arguments. In Python, the single-asterisk form of `*args` can be used to take a non-keyworded variable-length list of arguments passed to a function. The double asterisk form of `**kwargs` can be used to take a keyworded, variable-length dictionary of arguments passed to a function. \n",
    "\n",
    "In `print_params_1()`, the variables `a` and `b` are positional arguments, and `c` is a keyworded argument. In `print_params_2()`, the variables `mysim`, `a`, and `b` are three positional arguments, which take `sim`, the string \"hello\", and the value 100 from the call to `sched()`. The additional positional arguments, \"yes\" and \"no\", are placed into the list `args`. The variable `c` is a keyworded argument. The rest of the keyworded arguments are placed into the dictionary `kwargs`. \n",
    "\n",
    "`print_params_3()` is a method inside `myclass`. We show two ways to identify it as an event handler. One way is pass the class method as the name of the function, followed by the class instance as the first positional argument. The other way is to directly use the method of the specific class instance. Python is smart enough to unpack it to be the class method and the class instance when `sched()` is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `sched()` function takes its own arguments. They are all keyworded arguments, such as `until`. The `sched()` function will first filter out the recognized keyworded arguments for itself, before scheduling the user intended function to be invoked at the designated time. All positional arguments and all unfiltered keyworded arguments are passed onto the event handler.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the parameters of a function need to occur in a particular order: first, the formal positional arguments, then `*args`, followed by the keyworded arguments, and finally `**kwargs`. That's exactly what we did for the `print_params_2` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.1.3  The Life of a Professor\n",
    "\n",
    "In simulus, one can of course schedule more functions to run within an event handler. The whole point of simulation is to help capture and examine the complicated logic or processes of the world (or system) as the events unfold. \n",

    "This example is mostly self-explanatory. There's but one subtle point. The simulation time in simulus is represented as an integer or a floating point number. In this example, we represent time in seconds from midnight. To make things a bit more comprehensible for the printout, in this example we use the standard `time` module in Python to convert the seconds into human readble formats: hours, minutes, and seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.1.4  Canceling and Rescheduling Events\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, the professor's schedule is rather boring. In real life, we make appointments and we cancel them sometimes. We also reschedule appointments. Let's make things a bit more interesting for the professor's life. Let's assume that today there's a big traffic jam. So instead of taking only 45 minutes, the professor takes 2 hours 45 minutes to get to school. Obviously, the professor will miss the first meeting and get late for the second one. So she cancels the first meeting and reschedules the second meeting. \n",
    "\n",
    "To do that we need to use the return value from the `sched()` method. It is actually a reference to an event that's got scheduled onto the simulator's event list. Event in simulus is an opaque object. That is, we can make a reference to the event (in order to cancel or reschedule the event), but we should not directly access the member variables and methods within the event instance. In this example, we call the simulator's `cancel()` and `resched()` methods and pass the event as the argument. The professor cancels and reschedules the events when she is about to leave home (assuming she can predict that the traffic jam is about to happen by then).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another difference of this example from the previous one is that we make professor's waking up a daily repeatable event (with a 24 hour interval). In this case, the professor always gets up at 4 AM every day and carries out the same set of activities (my goodness!). If we `run()` the simulation without an argument, it would never return as there will always be events on the event list. Because of that, in this example, we call `run()` with a designated simulation end-time using the keyworded argument `until`. Specifically for this example, we run the simulation for a duration of three days."

In that case, the earlier simulator will no longer be retrievable using the name. A simulator's name is optional. A simulator can be created without a name.

That is, the current time at one simulator has no relation to the current time of another simulator. This is the default behavior.

    "Each simulator processes its own events when we call the `run()` function. We can specify either `offset` or `until` when we call `run()`, in which case the simulator will process all events with timestamps no larger than the designated time. The `offset` argument specifies a relative time from the simulator's current simulation time. The `until` argument specifies an absolute time. When the `run()` function returns, the current time of the simulator will be advanced to the designated time and all events on the event list with timestamps smaller than or equal to the designated time have already been processed. If both `offset` and `until` are ignored, the simulator will run as long as there are events on the event list. The user should be aware that, in this case, a simulator may run forever as in some simulation models there are always new events generated when the event handlers are invoked (like in the previous example).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also step through simulation by processing one event at a time. This is achieved by the simulator's `step()` function, which only processes the next event on the event list and advances the simulation time to the time of the event before it returns. If there is no event available on the event list, the method has no effect and returns immediately. \n",
    "\n",
    "To determine the time of the next event, we can use the simulator's `peek()` function. We can also list all future events on the event list using the simulator's `show_calendar()` function. This function is supposed to be used only for debugging purposes. Listing all events on an event list can be quite expensive for some simulators.\n",

    "This example is the first time in this tutorial we deal with random numbers. It needs a bit explanation. We use Python's `random` package. In particular, we use the `seed()` function to select a random seed for the default random number generator, so that every time we run this example, we should get the same results. In simulation, we call the series of numbers generated by the `random` package *pseudo-random numbers*. The numbers indeed look random, but they are not really random. They follow a fixed sequence although seemingly unpredictabe. As long as we start the random sequence with a fixed seed, the sequence is guaranteed be the same.\n",

    "## 3.  Inter-Process Communication\n",
    "\n",
    "Processes often need to interact with one another in order to accomplish tasks. In the previous homework example, we saw one simplest way to communicate among the processes: the `homework` process waits for the completion of all `student` processes. Simulus provides a rich set of mechanisms to support inter-process communication. We start by discussing the two basic primitive methods designed specifically for synchronizing and communicating among the simulation processes: one is called a \"trap\" and the other is called a \"semaphore\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1  Traps\n",
    "\n",
    "Traps are one-time signaling mechanisms for inter-process communication. A trap has three states. It's \"unset\" when the trap is first created and and nothing has happended to it. It's \"set\" when one or more processes are waiting for the trap to be triggered. It turns to \"sprung\" when the trap has been triggered, after which there will be no more processes waiting for the trap.\n",
    "\n",
    "The life of a trap is as follows. A trap starts with the \"unset\" state when it's created. When a process waits for a trap, the trap goes to \"set\", at which state more processes may come and wait on the same trap, and the trap would remain in the same \"set\" state. When a process triggers the trap and if the trap is in the \"set\" state, *all* processes waiting on the trap will be unblocked and resume execution (it's guaranteed there is at least one waiting process when the trap is in the \"set\" state). The trap will then be transitioned into the \"sprung\" state. When a process triggers the trap which is in the \"unset\" state, the trap will just be transitioned to the \"sprung\" state (since there are no processes currently waiting on the trap). If a trap has \"sprung\", further waiting on the trap will be considered as an no-op; that is, the processes trying to wait on a \"sprung\" trap will have not effect; the process will not be suspended. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.1.1  One-Time Signaling\n",
    "\n",
    "A trap is a very simple signaling mechanism. One or more processes can wait on a trap. When another process triggers the trap, all the waiting processes will be released at once. It is important to know that a trap is for **one-time use** only. Once sprung, a trap cannot be triggered any more, or simulus will raise an exception.

    "The `Barrier` class implements the barrier. One creates a barrier with two arguments: the simulator on which the processes are run and the total number of processes expected at the barrier. Internally, we create a trap for the synchronization and use a counter (called `num`) to keep track of the number of processes having reached the barrier so far. The counter is initialized to zero. Each time a process wants to use the barrier, it calls the `barrier()` method, which increments the counter. If the counter is smaller than the total number of processes, the process will be put on hold (using the trap's `wait()` method). Otherwise, if the counter gets to the total number of processes, the process is the last one among the group of processes to reach the barrier. Therefore, it calls the trap's `trigger()` method to release all the waiting processes that have earlier arrived at the barrier. Remember that traps can only be used once. To make the barrier reusable, we create a new trap each time the last process reaches the barrier. We also reset the counter.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we create 10 processes. Each process waits for some random time (exponentially distributed) and then calls `barrier()`. Once the method returns, the process repeats the same: it waits for some random time and calls for the next barrier.\n",

    "Semaphores are multi-use signaling mechanisms for inter-process communication. It is the other primitive method beside traps designed for synchronizing and communicating simulation processes. \n",
    "\n",
    "In simulus, a semaphore implements what is commonly called a \"counting semaphore.\" Initially, a semaphore can have a nonnegative integer count, which indicates the number of available resources. The processes atomically increment the semaphore count to represent resources being added or returned to the pool (using the `signal()` method). Similarly, the processes atomically decrement the semaphore count to represent resources being removed from the pool (using the `wait()` method). When the semaphore count is zero, it means that there are no available resources. In that case, a process trying to decrement the semaphore (to remove a resource) will be blocked until more resources are added back to the pool. \n",
    "\n",
    "A semaphore is different than a trap. A trap is a one-time signaling mechanism. Multiple processes can wait on a trap. Once a process triggers the trap, *all* waiting processes will be unblocked. Moreover, a trap cannot be reused: once a trap is sprung, subsequent waits will not block the processes and a trap cannot be triggered again. In comparison, a semaphore is a multi-use signaling mechanism. Each time a process waits on a semaphore, the semaphore value will be decremented. If the value becomes negative, the process will be blocked. Each time one signals a semaphore, the semaphore value will be incremented. If there are blocked processes, *one* of these processes will be unblocked. Processes can use the same semaphore continuously multiple times.\n",

In its simpliest form, the problem consists of two processes. A producer process repeatedly generates data and put them into a common, fixed sized buffer. A consumer consumes the data by removing them from the buffer one at a time. The problem is that the producer cannot put data into the buffer if the buffer is already full. Similarly, the consumer cannot remove data from the buffer if the buffer is empty.\n",

    "### 3.3  Trappables and Conditional Wait\n",
    "\n",
    "Both traps and semaphores are called **trappables**. An event (i.e., a scheduled function) is a trappable. A process is also a trappable. Simulus provides a very powerful function called `wait()` to block the calling process until any or all of the given trappables are triggered, or until a pre-specified amount of time has elapsed. When we say a trappable is \"triggered\", we mean that the wait condition on the trappable has been satisfied. If it's a trap, it means the trap has been triggered by another process. If it's a semaphore, it means a wait on the semaphore has returned. If it's an event, it means the event has happened (and the event handler has been invoked). If it's a process, it means the process has terminated. \n",
    "\n",
    "In case of a trap, if we have only one trap, say `t`, calling the wait method of the trap, `t.wait()`, is equivalent to calling the simulator's `wait()` function with the trap passed as the argument: `sim.wait(t)`. Similarly, in case of a semaphore, if we have only one semaphore, say `s`, `s.wait()` is equivalent to `sim.wait(s)`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The simulator's `wait()` function expects the argument to be either one trappable or a list of trappables. If it takes more than one trappables in a list or tuple, the calling process will be blocked until either *one* of the trappables, or *all* of the trappables are triggered. The behavior depends on the `method` argument: if it's `any`, the wait condition is satisfied as soon as one of the trappables is triggered; if it's 'all', the process needs to wait until all trappables are triggered. If the method argument is not provided, simulus assumes it's 'all' by default.\n",

    "In this example, we create two traps, t1 and t2, and two semaphores, s1 and s2. We also create two processes. The process p1 triggers a trap or a semaphore at 10 seconds interval. The other process p2 first waits on a trap and a semaphore using the default method ('all'). As expected, the process only resumes execution once both trappables have been triggered. The p2 process then waits on the other trap and semaphore using the `any` method. In this case, when one trappable is triggered, the process will resume execution. It then filters out the triggered trappables from the list and creates another list with the remaining untriggered trappables (actually there's only one left), and then wait until all of the remaining trapples are triggered.\n",
    "\n",
    "The return from the `wait()` function needs a bit more explanation. The `wait()` function actually returns a tuple with two elements: the first element of the tuple indicates whether the trappables have been triggered or not; and the second element of tuple indicates whether timeout happens. Since in this example, we don't use timed wait, the `wait()` function always returns False in the second element.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the first argument when calling the `wait()` function is but one trappable (not in a list or tuple), the first element of the returned tuple will simply be a boolean (True or False), indicating whether the trappable has been triggered or not upon the return of the function. If, on the other hand, the first argument when calling the `wait()` functionis a list or a tuple of trappables (even if with just one trappable), the first element of the returned tuple will be a list of booleans, where each element of the list indicates whether the corresponding trappable has been triggered.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example, when the `wait()` function is called the first time, it returns a list with True and True for the first element of the returned tuple, since both trappables must be triggered before the process can resume execution (because of the 'all' method). In the second time, the function returns True and False. Only the first trappable (the trap t2) is triggered at the time. Because of the method is 'any', one triggered trappable is good enough to satisfy the wait condition. at the third time, the remaining trappable (semaphore s2) is triggered and the function returns a list consisted of only one True element.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can optionally provide an 'offset' or an 'until' argument to the `wait()` function. The 'offset' is the relative time from now until which the process will be put on hold at the latest; if provided, it must be a non-negative value. The 'until' is the absolute time at which the process is expected to resume execution at the latest; if provided, it must not be earlier than the current time.  Eœither 'offset' or 'until' can be provided, but not both. If both 'offset' and 'until' are ignored (like what we have previously), there will be no time limit on the conditional wait.\n",

    "\n",
    "To be able to perform conditional wait on multiple trappables certainly allows a process-oriented model to be quite expressive. The following shows a good example. Tom and Jerry decides to enter a race. Tom is modeled by processes. Each time Tom enters the race, we create a process, which calls `sleep()` to represent the time duration for the run. The time duration is a random variable from a normal distribution with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 50 (and a cutoff below zero). Jerry is modeled by events. Each time Jerry enters the race, we schedule an event using `sched()` with a time offset representing the time duration for the run. The time duration is a random variable from a uniform distribution between 50 and 100. Tom and Jerry compete for ten times; the next race would start as soon as the previous one finishes. For each race, whoever runs the fastest wins. But if they run for more than 100, both are disqualified for that race. The simulation finds out who eventually wins more races."

    "Earlier in the previous example, we showed traps and semaphores as trappables on which we can perform conditional wait. In this example, we show that both events and processes are also trappables. An instance of the process is returned from the `process()` function, and an instance of the event is returned from the `sched()` function. Both are considered as opaque objects. That is, the users are not expected to inspect the content of a process or event. Rather, the users should simple use the references. A process is a trappable, which is triggered when the process is terminated. An event is also a trappable, which is triggered upon the activation of the event (i.e., when the event handler is invoked).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we call the simulator's `wait()` function to wait for 'any' of the trappables to be triggered. We also provide a time limit of 100 (we use 'offset' as a positional argument). We look at the return value from the `wait()` function to determine the outcome of the race. If the wait is timed out, we need to kill the process and cancel the event. This is done by calling the simulator's `cancel()` method. If Tom wins (when p is triggered), we just cancel the event; and if Jerry wins (when e is triggered), we instead kill the process.\n",

    "## 4. Resources and Facilities\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous section, we discussed traps and semaphores, which are the two primitive methods in simulus for process synchronization. Simulus provides several advanced mechanisms to coordinate processes and facilitate inter-process communication in order to ease the modeling effort. In this section, we discuss three such mechanisms: resource, store, and mailbox.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 Resource\n",
    "\n",
    "A semaphore is a primitive method to represent a resource. A process can atomically increment the semaphore to represent a resource has been added to the pool. A process can also atomically decrement the semaphore to represent a resource being removed from the pool. \n",
    "\n",
    "Simulus actually provides a high-level abstraction of the resources, making it easier for users to create expressive models. A resource basically models a single-server or multi-server queue. A resource can allow only a limited number of processes to be serviced at any given time. A process arrives and acquires a server at the resource. If there is an available server, the process will gain access to the resource for as long as the service is required. If there isn't an available server, the process will be put on hold and placed in a waiting queue. When another process has finished and released the server, one of the waiting processes will be unblocked and thereby gain access to the resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "A process is expected to perform the following sequence of actions to use the resource. The process first calls the `acquire()` method to gain access to a server. This is potentially a blocking call: the process may be blocked if there's no avaiable server. The call returns if a server is available and has been assigned to the process. The process has acquired the resource. The process can then use the resource for as long as it needs to; this is usually modeled using the `sleep()` method. Afterwards, the same process is expected to call the `release()` method on the resource to free the server, so that other waiting processes may have a chance to gain access to the resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.1.1 A Single-Server Queue\n",
    "\n",
    "The following example shows the use of resource for simulating a single-server queue. It's an M/M/1 queue with exponentially distributed inter-arrival time and exponentially distributed service time. We first create a resource with one server (capacity is one by default). We create an arrival process, which creates a job after sleeping for some random inter-arrival time in a forever loop. A job is a process. It first tries to `acquire()` a server from the resource. If the resource is unavailable (no available server), the job process will be suspended. Otherwise, the job is assigned with a server. The process sleeps for some random service time and then calls `release()` to free the server before leaving the queue (and terminating)."

    "\n",
    "A store is used for synchronizing producer and consumer processes. A store is a facility either for storing countable objects (such as jobs in a queue, packets in a network router, and io requests at a storage device), or for storing uncountable quantities or volumes (such as gas in a tank, water in a reservoir, and battery power in a mobile device). The user can determine which kind of store (for countable objects or for uncountable quantities) should apply upon use.\n",
    "\n",
    "A store has a maximum capacity, which is a positive quantity specified either as an integer or as a float-point number. A store can also tell its current storage level, which goes between zero and the maximum capacity. One or several processes can put objects or quantities into the store. They are called the \"producer processes\". One or several processes can get objects or quantities from the store. They are called the \"consumer processes\". The producer processes and the consumer processes are determined by their performed actions on the store. They can actually be the same process.\n",
    "\n",
    "A producer process calls the `put()` method to deposit one or more objects or some quantities into the store. The put amount shall be specified as an argument (default is one). The current storage level will increase accordingly as a result. However, if a producer process tries to put objects or quantities into the store such that the storage level would be more than the store's capacity, the producer process will be blocked. The process will remain to be blocked until the storage level decreases (when some other processes get objects or quantities from the store) so that there is room for putting all the objects or quantities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, a consumer process calls the `get()` method to retrieve one or more objects or some quantities from the store. The get amount shall be specified as an argument (default is one).  The current storage level will decrease accordingly as a result. If a consumer process tries to get more objects or quantities than what is avaialble at the store, the consumer process will be blocked. The process will remain blocked until the current storage level goes above the requested amount (when some other processes put objects or quantities into the store).\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, we only specify the amount of objects or quantities to put into the store or get from the store. Actually, the store facility can be used for storing real (countable) Python objects, if the user calls the `put()` method and passes in a Python object or a list/tuple of Python objects using the keyworded 'obj' argument. In this case, the put amount must match with the number of objects. These Python objects can be retrieved in a first-in-first-out fashion by consumer processes calling the `get()` method, which specifies the get amount. The same number of Python objects will be returned, either in a list if the get amount is greater than one, or by the object itself if the get amount is one.\n",

    "The gas station has two fuel pumps sharing a fuel tank of 200 liters. The gas station is modeled as resource (with a capacity of two). And the shared fuel tank is modeled as a store (with a capacity of 200). The cars are processes which are created by the `car_generator()` process, one at a time with some random inter-arrival time. A car arriving at the gas station first tries to acquire the a fuel pump from the gas station. Once a fuel pump is avaiable, the car gets the desired amount of gas from the fuel pump using the `get()` method, and then release the fuel pump before it leaves the gas station.\n",
    "\n",
    "The gas station has a separate fuel level monitoring process, called `gas_station_control()`. It checks the fuel level at regular intervals (every 10 seconds). When the fuel level drops below a threshold, a tank truck will be called to refuel the tank. It takes a while for the fuel truck to arrive and when it does, it will fill up the tank using the `put()` method.\n",

    "#### 4.2.3  Conditional Wait on Stores\n",
    "\n",
    "The store facility is not a trappable. That is, you can't use it directly for conditional wait. There are two reasons. One is that a store has two methods, `get()` and `put()`, both of which could block a process. We would need to explicitly specify which of the two a process should be waiting on. The other reason is that both `get()` and `put()` methods can take arguments. The `get()` method can take the number of countable objects or the amount of uncountable quantities to be retrieved. The `put()` method can take the number or amount and also the objects themselves if so desired. \n",
    "\n",
    "To allow conditional wait, the store provides two methods, `getter()` and `putter()`, that return the corresponding trappable for either retrieving from the store or depositing into the store, respectively. The returned trappables can be used in a conditional wait.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following example, we create a scenario where a process, called `checker()`, tries to retrieve jobs from several queues (5 of them in total), one at a time. The queues are modeled as stores. The process also makes sure it checks on the time every 2 seconds. To do all these, the checker process performs a conditional wait by calling the `sim.wait()` function on the `getter()` trappables from all stores and specify a timeout using 'until'. Depending on whether timeout happens or not, the process prints on a message."

    "\n",
    "### 4.3 Mailbox\n",
    "\n",
    "A mailbox is a facility designed specifically for message passing between processes or functions. A mailbox consists of one or more compartments or partitions. A sender can send a message to one of the partitions of the mailbox (which, by default, is partition 0) with a time delay. The message will be delivered to the designated mailbox partition at the expected time. Messages arriving at a mailbox will be stored in the individual partitions until a receiver retrieves them and removes them from the mailbox.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the concept of messages (or mails in the sense of a mailbox) takes a broader meaning.  Basically, they could be any Python objects. And since Python is a dynamically-typed language, one can also use objects of different types as messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "A mailbox is designed to be used for both process scheduling (in process-oriented simulation) and direct-event scheduling (for event-driven simulation). In the former, a process can send as many messages to a mailbox as it needs to (by repeatedly calling the mailbox's `send()` method). The simulation time does not advance since `send()` does not block. As a matter of fact, one does not need to call `send()` in a process context at all. In this sense, a mailbox can be considered as a store with an infinite storage capacity.  An important difference, however, is that one can send messages to mailboxes and specify a different delay each time.\n",
    "\n",
    "One or more processes can call the mailbox's `recv()` method trying to receive the messages arrived at a mailbox partition. If there are one or more messages already stored at the mailbox partition, the process will retrieve the messages from the partition and return them (in a list) without delay. Here, \"retrieve\" means the messages indeed will be removed from the mailbox partition.  In doing so, subsequent calls to `recv()` will no longer find the retrieved messages in the mailbox partition. If there are no messages currently in the mailbox partition when calling `recv()`, the processes will be suspended pending on the arrival of a new message to the designated mailbox partition. Once a message arrives, *all* waiting processes at the partition will be unblocked and return with the retrieved message.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways for the `recv()` method to retrieve the messages. One is to retrieve all messages from the mailbox partition; the other is to retrieve only the first one stored in the mailbox partition. The user can specify which behavior is desirable by setting the 'isall' parameter when calling the `recv()` method.  Regardless of the process trying to receive all messages or just one message, if there are multiple processes waiting to receive at a mailbox partition, it is possible a process wakes up upon a message's arrival and return empty handed (because another process may have taken the message from the mailbox). Simulus do not dictate, when multiple processes are waiting to receive a message, which one will wake up first to retrieve the messages. It'd be arbitrary since simulus handles simultaneous events without model specified ordering.\n",
    "\n",
    "A mailbox can also be used in the direct-event scheduling context (event-driven approach). In this case, the user can add one or more callback functions to a mailbox partition (using the `add_callback()` method). A callback function can be any user-defined function. Whenever a message is delivered to a mailbox partition, *all* callback functions attached to the mailbox partition will be invoked.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within a callback function, the user has the option to either peek at the mailbox or retrieve (or do nothing of the kind, of course).  One can call the `peek()` method to just look at the messages arrived at a mailbox partition. In this case, a list is returned containing all stored messages in the partition. The messages are not removed from the mailbox. One can also also call the `retrieve()` method. In this case, the user is given the option to retrieve just one of the messages or all messages. Again, \"retrieve\" means to remove the message or messages from the mailbox. Like `recv()`, the user passes in a boolean 'isall' argument to indicate which behavior is desirable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.3.1 The PHOLD Example\n",
    "\n",
    "The following example shows a simple use of mailbox. We use the PHOLD model, which has been commonly used for benchmarking parallel and distributed simulators. Here we create four processes, called `generate()`, each representing a node. We also create the same number of mailboxes, one for each process. The `generate()` process tries to receive a job (a message from the mailbox), one at a time, by calling the `recv()` method with 'isall' set to be False. The process then forwards the job to a randomly selected node by calling `send()` with a random delay. To start the simulation, we initially send 10 jobs to the randomly selected nodes. "

    "In this example, we create one mailbox (with a single partition). We attach a callback function `peek()` to the mailbox (partition zero). Every time the mailbox receives a message, the `peek()` function will be invoked and the function literally just takes a peek at the mailbox and lists all the messages therein.\n",

    "The `get_one()` process sleeps for 1 second (from the previous receive) and tries to retrieve one message from the mailbox. It may be blocked if the mailbox is empty. As we can see from the example, the number of messages in the mailbox seems to increase over time, since the `generate()` may send more messages than those consumed by the `get_one()` process. \n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid indefinite increase of the buffered messages, the `get_all()` process sleeps for 5 seconds and then tries to retrieve all messages from the mailbox in one call to `recv()` method. From the print-out, we can examine whether the behavior of the peeks and retrieves is as expected.\n",

    "#### 4.3.3 Conditional Waits on Mailboxes\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to store, the mailbox facility is not a trappable. That is, one cannot use the mailbox directly for conditional wait. We have the same reasons. a mailbox can have multiple partitions, the `recv()` method can be blocked on receiving messages from any of the partitions. The other reason is that the `recv()` method is expected to retrieve and return one or all of the messages depending on the 'isall' argument. To allow conditional wait, mailblox provides the `receiver()` method, which returns the corresponding trappable for receiving messages from a designated mailbox partition.  \n",

    "In the following example, we model the routine of a mailman and his patron. The overworked mailman is a process, who starts the day at 8 o'clock and sorts all mails until 2 o'clock in the afternoon. Then he starts to deliver the mails, which may take between one and five hours. We model this by sending a message to his patron's mailbox with a random delay. The patron is another process, who comes back from work at 5 o'clock every day. He does a timed wait on the mailbox, representing his checking the mailbox until 6 o'clock. If the mail arrives before 6, the patron receives it. Otherwise, the patron gives up and he'll receive it by next day.  "
