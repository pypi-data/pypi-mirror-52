    "Simulus supports parallel and distributed simulation via concurrent execution of multiple simulators. These simulators can be created and run simultaneously on different processors or cores on the same or different machines in a cluster. To distinguish the two cases, we use the term \"parallel simulation\" to refer to running simulation on shared-memory multiprocessors, and use the term \"distributed simulation\" to refer to running simulation on distributed-memory machines in a cluster. The use of these terms have not been standardized in the community. For example, people have been using the term \"parallel simulation\" to refer to both cases. \n",
    "\n",
    "To understand how simulus handles parallel and distributed simulation, we first introduce the concept of a synchronized group of simulators, where time advances synchronously among the simulators in the group. In addition, when a simulator belongs to a synchronized group, it can also communicate with the other simulators in the group. A synchronized group may consist of simulators running on multiprocessors or on parallel machines in a cluster. "

That is, although each simulator still processes events on its own event list according to the timestamp ordering, the simulators in a synchronized group will advance their simulation clock in a coordinated fashion such that no one simulator will get too far ahead in simulation time from the rest of the simulators in the group. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, synchronization or coordination must take place so as to guarantee that an event generated from one simulator destined for another simulator in the synchronized group would not arrive in the simulated past. This would happen, however, if the other simulator's clock gets too far ahead into the simulated future, so when other simulators generate messages destined for this simulator, these messages may arrive at the simulator's past. In parallel discrete-event simulation terminology, this is called a causality error. \n",
    "\n",
    "Causality error should never happen in simulation as long as we are modeling a world without time traveling. In parallel simulation, one has to contemplate the possibility of causality errors as simulators may executed on separate processors or cores, or even on separate machines. To solve the problem, one should either constrain the time advancement of the simulators to prevent causality errors from ever happening, or somehow rollback the simulators to an earlier state to correct the causality errors. \n",

    "Running parallel simulation on a single machine has its obvious limitations. First, the number of processors available on one machine is small, which would severely limit the level of parallelism and therefore the achievable speedup. Theoretically, with even perfect parallelism, it would be impossible for parallel simulation on 16 processors to achieve a speedup beyond 16.  Second, the amount of memory available on one machine is very limited. Large-scale simulation commonly consumes an enormous amount of memory and therefore would not fit on a single machine. Last, modern parallel architectures are popular with high-end clusters which consist of a large number of distributed-memory computing servers connected via high-speed interconnect. \n",

    "Single Program Multiple Data (SPMD) is the most common parallel programming paradigm. In SPMD, multiple machines simultaneously execute the same program, each operating on a different input or a different portion of the same data. Each machine is identified with a rank, which is an integer that ranges from 0 to the total number of machines minus one. Note that we use the word 'machine' here to generally refer to an MPI process. An MPI process is actually just a regular process that uses MPI routines for communication. One can create as many MPI processes as needed, which can be mapped to the parallel computers on which applications are run. MPI provides methods to create the mapping: one can map each MPI process to a separate computer; one can also map multiple MPI processes onto one computer (say, one corresponding to each processor or core).\n",

Each simulus instance runs as an MPI process. One can create as many simulus instances as needed. Each simulus instance is identified by a rank, which is an integer that ranges from 0 to the total number of simulus instances. The simulus instances are mapped by MPI onto the parallel computers for large-scale models, say one on each physical machine. Each simulus instance can also create multiple processes, say one for each processor core.\n",

    "The PHOLD model consists of a number of nodes that are passing messages to one another. First, we define a class for the nodes. Each node runs in a simulator ('sim'). It has an index number ('node_idx') that ranges from zero to the total number of nodes ('total_nodes') minus one. Each node also contains a mailbox ('mbox') with a distinct name (derived from the node's index, 'node_idx'). The mailbox also has a minimum delay ('lookahead'). Each node also creates a process with a starting function called 'forward_jobs()'. During simulation, the process repeatedly waits for jobs (from this and other nodes) and then forward them to other randomly selected nodes."
