    "A semaphore is a primitive method to represent a resource. A process can atomically increment the semaphore to represent a resource has been added to the pool. A process can also atomically decrement the semaphore to represent a resource being removed from the pool. \n",

    "Simulus actually provides a high-level abstraction of the resources, making it easier for users to create expressive models. A resource basically models a single-server or multi-server queue. A resource can allow only a limited number of processes to be serviced at any given time. A process arrives and acquires a server at the resource. If there is an available server, the process will gain access to the resource for as long as the service is required. If there isn't an available server, the process will be put on hold and placed in a waiting queue. When another process has finished and released the server, one of the waiting processes will be unblocked and thereby gain access to the resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "A process is expected to perform the following sequence of actions to use the resource. The process first calls the `acquire()` method to gain access to a server. This is potentially a blocking call: the process may be blocked if there's no available server. The call returns if a server is available and has been assigned to the process. The process has acquired the resource. The process can then use the resource for as long as it needs to; this is usually modeled using the `sleep()` method. Afterwards, the same process is expected to call the `release()` method on the resource to free the server, so that other waiting processes may have a chance to gain access to the resource."

    "The following example shows the use of resource for simulating a single-server queue. It's an M/M/1 queue with exponentially distributed inter-arrival time and exponentially distributed service time. We first create a resource with one server (capacity is one by default). We create an arrival process, which creates a job after sleeping for some random inter-arrival time in a forever loop. A job is a process. It first tries to `acquire()` a server from the resource. If the resource is unavailable (no available server), the job process will be suspended. Otherwise, the job is assigned with a server. The process sleeps for some random service time and then calls `release()` to free the server before leaving the queue (and terminating)."

A bucket is used for storing uncountable quantities or volumes, such as gas in a tank, water in a reservoir, and battery power in a mobile device.\n",

A store or a bucket can also tell its current storage level, which goes between zero and the maximum capacity. One or several processes can put objects into the store or some quantities into the bucket. They are called the \"producer processes\". One or several processes can get objects from the store or some quantities from the bucket. They are called the \"consumer processes\". The producer processes and the consumer processes are determined by their performed actions (get or put). They can actually be the same process.\n",

    "A producer process calls the `put()` method to deposit one or more objects into the store, or some quantities into the bucket. The put amount shall be specified as an argument. For the store, the default is one. The current storage level will increase accordingly as a result. However, if a producer process tries to put objects or quantities into the store or bucket such that the storage level would be more than the maximum capacity, the producer process will be blocked. The process will remain to be blocked until the storage level decreases (when some other processes get objects or quantities from the store or bucket) so that there is room for putting all the objects or quantities.\n",

Other than that, actually, the store facility can be used optionally for storing real Python objects. This is when the user calls the store's `put()` method and passes in a Python object or a list/tuple of Python objects using the keyword 'obj' argument. In this case, the put amount must match with the number of objects. These Python objects can be retrieved in a first-in-first-out fashion by consumer processes calling the `get()` method of the store, which specifies the get amount. The same number of Python objects will be returned, either in a list if the get amount is greater than one, or by the object itself if the get amount is one."

    "Both the store facility and the bucket facility are not trappables. That is, we can't use it directly for conditional wait. There are two reasons. One is that a store or a bucket has two methods, `get()` and `put()`, both of which could block a process. We would need to explicitly specify on which of the two the process should be waiting. The other reason is that both `get()` and `put()` methods can take arguments. The `get()` method can take the number of countable objects (for store) or the amount of uncountable quantities (for bucket) to be retrieved. The `put()` method can take the number or amount. For store, one can also deposit the objects using `put()` if so desired. \n",

    "To allow conditional wait, the store and the bucket provide two methods, `getter()` and `putter()`, that return the corresponding trappable for either retrieving from the store or bucket, or depositing into the store or bucket, respectively. The returned trappables can be used in a conditional wait.\n",

The queues are modeled as stores. The process also makes sure it checks on the time every 2 seconds. To do all these, the checker process performs a conditional wait by calling the `sim.wait()` function on the `getter()` trappables from all stores and specify a timeout using 'until'. Depending on whether timeout happens or not, the process prints on a message."

   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "A mailbox is a facility designed specifically for message passing between processes or functions. A mailbox consists of one or more compartments or partitions. A sender can send a message to one of the partitions of the mailbox (which, by default, is partition 0) with a time delay. The message will be delivered to the designated mailbox partition at the expected time. Messages arriving at a mailbox will be stored in the individual partitions until a receiver retrieves them and removes them from the mailbox.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the concept of messages (or mails in the sense of a mailbox) takes a broader meaning.  Basically, they could be any Python objects. And since Python is a dynamically-typed language, one can also use objects of different types as messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "A mailbox is designed to be used for both process scheduling (in process-oriented simulation) and direct-event scheduling (for event-driven simulation). In the former, a process can send as many messages to a mailbox as it needs to (by repeatedly calling the mailbox's `send()` method). The simulation time does not advance since `send()` does not block. As a matter of fact, one does not need to call `send()` in a process context at all. In this sense, a mailbox can be considered as a store with an infinite storage capacity.  An important difference, however, is that one can send messages to mailboxes and specify a different delay each time.\n",
    "\n",
    "One or more processes can call the mailbox's `recv()` method trying to receive the messages arrived at a mailbox partition. If there are one or more messages already stored at the mailbox partition, the process will retrieve the messages from the partition and return them (in a list) without delay. Here, \"retrieve\" means the messages indeed will be removed from the mailbox partition.  In doing so, subsequent calls to `recv()` will no longer find the retrieved messages in the mailbox partition. If there are no messages currently in the mailbox partition when calling `recv()`, the processes will be suspended pending on the arrival of a new message to the designated mailbox partition. Once a message arrives, *all* waiting processes at the partition will be unblocked and return with the retrieved message.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways for the `recv()` method to retrieve the messages. One is to retrieve all messages from the mailbox partition; the other is to retrieve only the first one stored in the mailbox partition. The user can specify which behavior is desirable by setting the 'isall' parameter when calling the `recv()` method.  Regardless of the process trying to receive all messages or just one message, if there are multiple processes waiting to receive at a mailbox partition, it is possible a process wakes up upon a message's arrival and return empty handed (because another process may have taken the message from the mailbox). Simulus do not dictate, when multiple processes are waiting to receive a message, which one will wake up first to retrieve the messages. It'd be arbitrary since simulus handles simultaneous events without model specified ordering.\n",
    "\n",
    "A mailbox can also be used in the direct-event scheduling context (event-driven approach). In this case, the user can add one or more callback functions to a mailbox partition (using the `add_callback()` method). A callback function can be any user-defined function. Whenever a message is delivered to a mailbox partition, *all* callback functions attached to the mailbox partition will be invoked.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within a callback function, the user has the option to either peek at the mailbox or retrieve (or do nothing of the kind, of course).  One can call the `peek()` method to just look at the messages arrived at a mailbox partition. In this case, a list is returned containing all stored messages in the partition. The messages are not removed from the mailbox. One can also also call the `retrieve()` method. In this case, the user is given the option to retrieve just one of the messages or all messages. Again, \"retrieve\" means to remove the message or messages from the mailbox. Like `recv()`, the user passes in a boolean 'isall' argument to indicate which behavior is desirable."

The `generate()` process tries to receive a job (a message from the mailbox), one at a time, by calling the `recv()` method with 'isall' set to be False.

We have the same reasons. a mailbox can have multiple partitions, the `recv()` method can be blocked on receiving messages from any of the partitions. The other reason is that the `recv()` method is expected to retrieve and return one or all of the messages depending on the 'isall' argument. To allow conditional wait, mailbox provides the `receiver()` method, which returns the corresponding trappable for receiving messages from a designated mailbox partition.  \n",

The overworked mailman is a process, who starts the day at 8 o'clock and sorts all mails until 2 o'clock in the afternoon. Then he starts to deliver the mails, which may take between one and five hours. We model this by sending a message to his patron's mailbox with a random delay. The patron is another process, who comes back from work at 5 o'clock every day. He does a timed wait on the mailbox, representing his checking the mailbox until 6 o'clock. If the mail arrives before 6, the patron receives it. Otherwise, the patron gives up and he'll receive it by next day.  "
