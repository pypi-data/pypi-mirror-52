Let's make things a bit more interesting for the professor's life. Let's assume that today there's a big traffic jam. So instead of taking only 45 minutes, the professor takes 2 hours 45 minutes to get to school. Obviously, the professor will miss the first meeting and get late for the second one. So she cancels the first meeting and reschedules the second meeting. \n",

Event in simulus is an opaque object. That is, we can make a reference to the event (in order to cancel or reschedule the event), but we should not directly access the member variables and methods within the event instance. In this example, we call the simulator's `cancel()` and `resched()` methods and pass the event as the argument. The professor cancels and reschedules the events when she is about to leave home (assuming she can predict that the traffic jam is about to happen by then).\n",

If we `run()` the simulation without an argument, it would never return as there will always be events on the event list. Because of that, in this example, we call `run()` with a designated simulation end-time using the keyword argument `until`.

That is, the current time at one simulator has no relation to the current time of another simulator. This is the default behavior. Simulators can also be time synchronized (using the `sync()` function). We will return to this topic later when we discuss the parallel and distributed simulation support of simulus.\n",

When the `run()` function returns, the current time of the simulator will be advanced to the designated time and all events on the event list with timestamps smaller than the designated time have already been processed. If both `offset` and `until` are ignored, the simulator will run as long as there are events on the event list. The user should be aware that, in this case, a simulator may run forever as in some simulation models there are always new events generated when the event handlers are invoked (like in the previous example).\n",
