Description: # cloudmicro platform library
        
        As most services require the requests to them to be authenticated and checked
        for permissions - the speed of traversing these requests via HTTPS is 
        prohibitive. Therefore, we give each service direct access to the platform
        database to query via predefined methods.
        
        This library also includes license, provider and user JSON serialisation. 
        
        Our mission is to have all single resource requests to return in under
        100ms, and this will never happen if we have to authenticate between
        microservices.
