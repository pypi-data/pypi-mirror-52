"""
collection of numpy wrapper functions.

The numpy library comes with a large array of functions for manipulation of
numpy.ndarray objects. Many of these functions are supported in Numpoly as
well.

For numpy version >=1.17, the numpy library started to support dispatching
functionality to subclasses. This means that the functions in numpoly with the
same name as a numpy counterpart will work irrespectively if the function used
was from numpy or numpoly.

For example::

    >>> poly = numpoly.symbols("x")**numpy.arange(4)
    >>> print(poly)
    [1 x x**2 x**3]
    >>> print(numpoly.sum(poly, keepdims=True))
    [1+x+x**2+x**3]
    >>> print(numpy.sum(poly, keepdims=True)) # doctest: +SKIP
    [1+x+x**2+x**3]

Not everything is possible to support, and for the functions that are
supported, not all arguments are supportable.
