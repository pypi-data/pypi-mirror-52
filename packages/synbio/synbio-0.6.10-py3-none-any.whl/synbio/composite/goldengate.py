class GoldenGate(Step):
    """GoldenGate assembly.

    Takes the design of a protocol and finds combinations of
    SeqRecords that will circularize into valid plasmids. The plasmids are
    filtered for those that will come together to make valid and new designs.

    Full responsibilities include:
        1. subselecting the input designs that will form valid plasmids
            after digestion with BsaI and BpiI
        2. adding NEB Golden Gate Assembly Mix to the valid designs as Contents for a Container
        3. computing the final plasmid (SeqRecord) after ligation of digested fragments
        4. memoize the sorted enzyme + ids -> SeqRecord from step #3, pass as a
            "mutate" method for the step after ThermoCycle()
        5. add steps to carry out the rest of the assembly (heat shock, incubate, etc)

    Keyword Arguments:
        resistance {str} -- resistance to use in backbone selection (default: {"KanR"}),
            remove all circularizable assemblies missing resistance to this backbone
        mix {Mix} -- the assembly mix to use when mixing the GoldenGate assemblies

            be considered valid. smaller assemblies are ignored
