Description: # CIAlign
        
        CIAlign is a command line tool which performs various functions to parse and analyse a multiple sequence alignment (MSA).
        
        The tool is designed to be highly customisable, allowing users to specify exactly which functions to run and which settings to use.  It is also transparent, generating a clear log file and diagram showing exactly how the alignment has changed.
        
        This allows the user to:
        * Remove sources of noise from their MSA
          * Crop of poorly aligned sequence ends
          * Remove of insertions which are not present in the majority of sequences
          * Remove of sequences below a threshold number of bases or amino acids
          * Remove columns containing only gaps
          * Remove sequences above a threshold level percentage of divergence from the majority
        
        * Generate consensus sequences
        
        * Visualise alignments
          * Generate image files showing the alignment before and after parsing and showing which columns and rows have been removed
          * Draw sequence logos
          * Visualise coverage at each postiion in the alignment
        
        * Analyse alignment statistics
          * Generate a similarity matrix showing the percentage identity between each sequence pair
          
        ## Requirements
        * python >= 3.6
        * matplotlib >= 2.1.1
        * numpy >= 1.16.3
        * scipy >= 1.3.0
        
        ## Installation
        
        The current release of CIAlign can be downloaded directly using [this link](https://github.com/KatyBrown/CIAlign/archive/v0.1.0.tar.gz)
        
        Add the CIAlign directory to your PATH environment variable as described [here](https://gist.github.com/nex3/c395b2f8fd4b02068be37c961301caa7)
        
        ## Usage
        ### Basic Usage
        `CIAlign --infile INFILE --outfile_stem STEM --inifile my_config.ini`
        
        #### Parameters
        Parameters can be specified in the command line or in a config file using the naming system below.
        
        A template config file is provided in CIAlign/templates/ini_template.txt - edit this file and provide the path to the --inifile argument.  If this argument is not provided command line arguments and defaults will be used.
        
        Parameters passed in the command line will take precedence over config file parameters, which take precedence over defaults.
        
        Command help can be accessed by typing `CIAlign --help`
        
        | Parameter | Description | Default |
        | ------------------------------------------------------ |------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
        | `--infile` | Path to input alignment FASTA file | None |

        ### Functions
        Specify which functions to run by adding the following optional arguments to the command
        
        ## Parsing an MSA
        Each of these steps will be performed sequentially in the order specified in the table below.
        
        The parsed alignment after all steps have been performed will be saved as **`OUTFILE_STEM_parsed.fasta`**

        | *`--crop_ends_mingap`* |  minimum gap size to consider when classifying a sequence as poorly aligned| 10 |
        | **`--remove_badlyaligned`** |  Remove sequences with <= N proportion of positions at which the most common base / amino acid in the alignment is present | False |
        | *`--remove_badlyaligned_minperc`* | Minimum proportion of positions which should be identical to the most common base / amino acid in order to be preserved | 0.9 |

        ## Generating a Consensus Sequence
        This step generates a consensus sequence based on the parsed alignment.  If no parsing functions are performed, the consensus will be based on the input alignment.
        
        Output files:
        
        * **`OUTFILE_STEM_consensus.fasta`** - the consensus sequence only
        * **`OUTFILE_STEM_with_consensus.fasta`** - the parsed alignment plus the consensus
        
        | Parameter | Description | Default |

        | **`--make_consensus`** | Make a consensus sequence based on the parsed alignment | False |
        | *`--consensus_type`* | Type of consensus sequence to make - can be majority, to use the most common character at each position in the consensus, even if this is a gap, or majority_nongap, to use the most common non-gap character at each position | majority |
        | *`--consensus_keepgaps`* | If there are gaps in the consensus (if majority_nongap is used as consensus_type), should these be included in the consensus (True) or should this position in the consensus be deleted (False) | False |
        | *`--consensus_name`* | Name to use for the consensus sequence in the output fasta file | consensus |
