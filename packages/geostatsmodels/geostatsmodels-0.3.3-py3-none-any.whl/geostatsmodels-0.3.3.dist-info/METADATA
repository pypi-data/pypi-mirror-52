geostatsmodels
==============

This is an implementation of ideas from Clayton V. Deutsch and Michael Pyrcz's book _Geostatistical Reservoir Modeling_ in order to better understand geostatistics. I am working through things first in Python in order to prototype things quickly and make sure I understand them.

There is also an R package for geostatistics named gstat, but I have not used it much.

This software is licensed under the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

Installation and Dependencies
-----------------------------

This package depends on:
 * `numpy`, the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. 
 * `matplotlib`, a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures. 
 * scipy, a Python library which provides many user-friendly and efficient numerical routines such as routines for numerical integration and optimization. 
 * `pandas`, a Python library which implements excellent tools for data analysis and modeling. 

The best/easiest way to install these packages is to use one of the Python distributions described [here](http://www.scipy.org/install.html). Anaconda has been successfully tested with geostatsmodels.

Most of those distributions should include `pip` or `conda`, which are command line tools for installing and 
managing Python packages.  You can use `pip` to install geostatsmodels itself.  

You may need to open a new terminal window to ensure that the newly installed versions of python and pip
are in your path.

To install geostatsmodels:

    pip install git+git://github.com/cjohnson318/geostatsmodels.git

Uninstalling and Updating
-------------------------

To uninstall:

    pip uninstall geostatsmodels

To update:

    pip install -U git+git://github.com/cjohnson318/geostatsmodels.git
