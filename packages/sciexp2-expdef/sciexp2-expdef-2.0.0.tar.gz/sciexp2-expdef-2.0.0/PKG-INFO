Description: SciExp²-ExpDef provides a framework for easing the workflow of creating and
        executing experiments, focused on *design-space exploration*.
        
        It is divided into the following main pieces:
        
        - Launchgen: Aids in defining experiments as a permutation of different
          parameters in the design space. It creates the necessary files to run these
          experiments (configuration files, scripts, etc.), which you define as
          templates that get substituted with the specific parameter values of each
          experiment.
        
        - Launcher: Takes the files of launchgen and runs these experiments on different
          execution platforms like regular local scripts or cluster jobs. It takes care
          of tracking their correct execution, and allows selecting which experiments to
          run (e.g., those with specific parameter values, or those that were not
          successfully run yet).
