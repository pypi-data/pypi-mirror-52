    :released: Ongoing

        :tickets: 2
        :pullreq: 20

        - ``__future__`` imports for ``.py`` files.
        - Replaces some instances of ``filter`` with list comprehensions.
        - Created a ``py2map`` inside of ``_compat`` to import into code, which preserves python 2.x's ``map`` behavior in python 3.
        - Update README.rst for python 3 support
        - Update ``setup.py`` classifier data
        - Update Travis for python 3.3 support (they don't have 3.4 support yet, tox passes 3.4 for me though)
        - Import ``reduce`` from ``functools``.
        - Add ``tox.ini`` file.
