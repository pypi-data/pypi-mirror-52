SUMMARY = 'Reorder and delete commits in the current branch'

DANGER = 'Rewrites history!'

HELP = """
Shuffles the commits in the current branch, perhaps deleting some.

The single argument is a pattern where underscores mean commits to be
deleted, and alphabetic characters mean commits to be shuffled.

For example, ``git shuffle ba`` switches the first and second most
recent commits, ``git shuffle cba`` swaps the first and third
commits, ``git shuffle cab`` pops the third commit to be the most
recent, top commit on the branch.

``git shuffle _ba`` deletes the most recent commit and then swaps
the next two; and ``git shuffle _a_b_c`` deletes the most recent, the
third most recent and the fifth most recent commit from the branch.

If omitted, the default pattern is ``ba``.  Only the order of the
letters matter so ``cba``, ``ZYX`` and ``zma`` mean the same thing."""

EXAMPLES = """
git shuffle
git shuffle ba
git shuffle YX
git shuffle 10
git shuffle 21
    Switches the first and second most recent commits

git shuffle ab
git shuffle abc
git shuffle ADE
git shuffle 01
git shuffle 12
    Do nothing

git shuffle 312
git shuffle cab
git shuffle zxy
    Cycles the three most recent commits so the third one is first

git shuffle __cba_
    Deletes the most recent two commeits, reverses the next three, and
    deletes the sixth.

git shuffle __cba_ -s "My message"
git shuffle __cba_ --squash="My message"
    Same as the previous command, but squashes the three commits into
    one with the commit message "My message"
