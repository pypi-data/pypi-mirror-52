Flest - small contribution to Flask world.
The goal is to help spend less time typing and coding to do more.
Explicit is better than implicit -- not always.
Convention saves a lot of time.
I truely believe that REST is a stupid idea.
/rsc/?id=3 makes much more sense than /rsc/3.
There is nothing wrong or heretic about POST /rsc/update?id=6.
If you think PUT /rsc/6 is more standard way, you may be an i(6 or 3)t.
