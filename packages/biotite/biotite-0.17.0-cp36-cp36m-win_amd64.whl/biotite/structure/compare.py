def rmsd(reference, subject):
    """
    Calculate the RMSD between two structures.
    
    Calculate the root-mean-square-deviation (RMSD)
    of a structure compared to a reference structure.
    The RMSD is defined as:
    
    .. math:: RMSD = \\sqrt{ \\frac{1}{n} \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n (x_i - x_{ref,i})^2}
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    reference : AtomArray
        Reference structure.
    subject : AtomArray or AtomArrayStack
        Structure(s) to be compared with `reference`.
        `reference` and `subject` must have equal annotation arrays.
    
    Returns
    -------
    rmsd : float or ndarray, dtype=float, shape=(n,)
        RMSD between subject and reference.
        If subject is an :class:`AtomArray` a float is returned.
        If subject is an :class:`AtomArrayStack` an :class:`ndarray`
        containing the RMSD for each :class:`AtomArray` is returned.

    Calculate the RMSF between two structures.
    
    Calculate the root-mean-square-fluctuation (RMSF)
    of a structure compared to a reference structure.
    The RMSF is defined as:
    
    .. math:: RMSF(i) = \\sqrt{ \\frac{1}{T} \\sum\\limits_{t=1}^T (x_i(t) - x_{ref,i}(t))^2}
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    reference : AtomArray
        Reference structure.
    subject : AtomArrayStack
        Structures to be compared with `reference`.
        reference` and `subject` must have equal annotation arrays.
        The time `t` is represented by the index of the first dimension
        of the AtomArrayStack.
    
    Returns
    -------
    rmsf : ndarray, dtype=float, shape=(n,)
        RMSF between subject and reference structure.
        The index corresponds to the atoms in the annotation arrays.

    Calculate an average structure.
    
    The average structure has the average coordinates
    of the input models.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    atom_arrays : AtomArrayStack
        Stack of structures to be averaged
    
    Returns
    -------
    average : AtomArray

    Notes
    -----
    The calculated average structure is not suitable for visualisation
    or geometric calculations, since bond lengths and angles will
    deviate from meaningful values.
    This method is rather useful to provide a reference structure for
    calculation of e.g. the RMSD or RMSF.

    Parameters
    ----------

    subject : AtomArray or AtomArrayStack
        Structure(s) whose atoms squared euclidian distance to
        `reference` is measured.
