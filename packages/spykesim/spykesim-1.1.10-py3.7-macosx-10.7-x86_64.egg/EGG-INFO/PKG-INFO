        spykesim is a Python module that offers functions for measuring the similarity between two segmented multi-neuronal spiking activities.
        
        Extended edit similarity measurement is implemented. You can find details in the following paper.
        
        https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2019.00039
        
        This library is re-implementation of the algorithm. The original implementation can be found in [this repo](https://github.com/KeitaW/Chaldea).
        
        # Supported Operating Systems
        This library tested on Ubuntu and MacOS.
        
        For Windows users: Please consider to use Ubuntu via [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).
        
        # Installation
        If you do not have Python3.7 on your environment, you may use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).
        
        [Cython](https://github.com/cython/cython) and [Numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) needs to be preinstalled as these will be used in the installation process.
        
        If you have not installed these packages, run the following:
        ```bash
        pip install numpy cython
        ```
        You can install this library via pip as well:
        ```bash
        pip install spykesim
        ```
        or you may clone and build by yourself:
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/KeitaW/spykesim.git
        cd spykesim
        python setup.py build_ext --inplace install
        ```
        
        ## Dependencies
        
        - Python (>= 3.7)
        - Numpy(Needs to be preinstalled)
        - Cython(Needs to be preinstalled)
        - scipy
