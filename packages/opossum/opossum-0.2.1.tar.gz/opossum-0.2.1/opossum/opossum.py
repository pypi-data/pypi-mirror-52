            random_assignment (boolean): If True, treatment is assigned randomly 
                according to assignment_prob parameter. If False, treatment 
                assignment is determined depending on covariates. 
                (default is True)
            assignment_prob (float or string): The probability with which 
                treatment is assigned. In the case of random assignment, it can
                be a float with 0 < prob < 1. If assignment is not random it
                should be one of the following strings: 'low', 'medium', 'high'.
                The strings stand for the values 0.35, 0.5, 0.65 respectively
                and can also be used in the non-random case.
                (default is 0.5)
            constant_pos (boolean): If True, the treatment effect is a positive
                constant.
                (default is True)
            constant_neg (boolean): If True, the treatment effect is a negative
                constant.
                (default is False)
            heterogeneous_pos (boolean): If True, the treatment effect is 
                positive and heterogeneous, i.e. it depends on a number of 
                covariates and varries in size. 
                (default is False)
            heterogeneous_neg (boolean): If True, the treatment effect is 
                negative and heterogeneous, i.e. it depends on a number of 
                covariates and varries in size.
                (default is False)
            no_treatment (boolean): If True, then there is no treatment effect.
                (default is False)
            discrete_heterogeneous (boolean): If True, then the treatment 
                effect consists of 2 values of different size. The size 
                is determined by a subset of covariates.
                (default is False)
            treatment_option_weights (list): List of length 6 with weights of 
                wanted treatment effects in the following order:
                [const_pos, const_neg, heterogeneous_pos, heterogeneous_neg, 
                no_treatment, discrete_heterogeneous]. Its values need to sum 
                up to 1. If chosen, the values overwrite the boolean parameters 
                for each treatment effect.
                (default is None)
            intensity (int or float): Value affects the size of the treatment 
                effect. Needs to be between 1 and 10. Formula for the actual
                magnitude of the treatment effects are: 
                const: intensity*0.2, heterogeneous: [0, intensity*0.4]

                (default is 5)
        
        Treatment assignment can be done randomly or determined by a subset Z of 
        covariates. The assignment probability can be freely chosen between 0 
        and 1 in the random case and from 3 levels ('low','medium','high') in 
        the non-random case.
        When creating the treatment effect, there are two ways to choose which 
        kind of effects are used. Either one sets all treatment effect booleans
        that are wanted to True and then they are equally weighted created, or
        one gives a list of length 6 with weights of the wanted distribution of 
        effects to the parameter treatment_option_weights, which overwrites 
        whatever booleans where chosen before.

            x_y_relation (string): Chooses the simulated relationship between 
                X and y. Possible values are: 
                'linear_simple', 'linear_interaction', 
                'partial_nonlinear_simple', 'partial_nonlinear_interaction',
                'nonlinear_simple', 'nonlinear_interaction'  
                (default is 'partial_nonlinear_simple')
                
        When simulating a dataset, there are different options to transform X
        into y. It can be linear or non-linear in different ways. The options
        that can be chosen for x_y_relation correspond to the following 
        functions:
        linear -> y ~ X
        partial non-linear -> y ~ 2.5*cos(X)^3 + 0.5*X
        non-linear -> y ~ 3*cos(X)^3 + 0.6*X
        Depending on the addition "simple" or "interaction" X consists only of
        single covariates x_i or additionally on random interaction terms of 
        some of the covariates x_i*x_j; i,j in{1,...,k}
        Generates output array "y" the following way: 
        Y = Theta_0 * D + g_0(X) + U,
        where Theta_O is the treatment effect of each observation, D the dummy 
        vector for assigning treatment, g_0() the transformation function, and 
        U a normal-distributed noise-/error term
