This Program is part of the tutorial.

Receives parameters from the option generated by the Rule [[rule:Demo-a-simple-timeseries-prediction]].

These parameters contain a timeseries that is to be predicted.

Performs a prediction on this timeseries.

Depending on what the user chose in the parameters, the timeseries is either displayed using a simple inbuilt graphing library, or that task is delegated to Elody's other programs.

If the timeseries entered by the user couldn't be parsed, a new Option is generated to ask them to enter it again.
