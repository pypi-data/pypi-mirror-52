        Features
        --------
        
        Pip Negotiator, read your requirements.txt file and create a new set of pinned requirements without conflicts with the
        already existing packages.
        
        This is useful when you want to install new Python Packages in a system without introducing conflicts.
        
        All the packages dependencies will be resolved by including the list of the already installed Python Packages. The result
        is a new output (requirements.txt format) that can be used with pip
        
        
        Usage::
        
            pip-negotiator -o resolved_requirements.txt requirements.txt
            pip install -U resolved_requirements.txt
        
        In case there is an error and the requirements cannot be resolved, use the debug mode to get an extensive analysis::
        
            pip-negotiator -L debug requirements.txt
        
        
        Help::
        
            pip-negotiator --help
