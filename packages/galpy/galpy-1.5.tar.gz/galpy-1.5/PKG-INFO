        The latest documentation can be found `here <http://galpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__. You can also join the `galpy slack community <https://galpy.slack.com/>`__ for any questions related to `galpy`; join `here <https://slackin-galpy.herokuapp.com>`__.
        
        If you find *any* bug in the code, please report these using the `Issue Tracker <http://github.com/jobovy/galpy/issues>`__ or by joining the `galpy slack community <https://galpy.slack.com/>`__.
        
        If you are having issues with the installation of ``galpy``, please first consult the `Installation FAQ <http://galpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#installation-faq>`__.
        
        PYTHON VERSIONS AND DEPENDENCIES
        ---------------------------------
        
        ``galpy`` supports both Python 2 and 3. Specifically, galpy supports
        Python 2.7 and Python 3.6 and 3.7. It should also work on earlier
        Python 3.* versions, but this is not extensively tested on an ongoing
        basis. Travis CI builds regularly check support for Python 2.7 and 3.7
        (and of 3.6 using a more limited, core set of tests) and Appveyor
        builds regularly check support for Python 3.7 on Windows.
        
        This package requires `Numpy <http://numpy.scipy.org/>`__, `Scipy
        <http://www.scipy.org/>`__, and `Matplotlib
        <http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/>`__. Certain advanced features
        require the GNU Scientific Library (`GSL
        <http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/>`__), with action calculations
        requiring version 1.14 or higher. Use of ``SnapshotRZPotential`` and
        ``InterpSnapshotRZPotential`` requires `pynbody
        <https://github.com/pynbody/pynbody>`__. Support for providing inputs
        and getting outputs as Quantities with units is provided through
        `astropy <http://www.astropy.org/>`__.
        
        CONTRIBUTING TO GALPY
        ----------------------
        
        If you are interested in contributing to galpy's development, take a look at `this brief guide <https://github.com/jobovy/galpy/wiki/Guide-for-new-contributors>`__ on the wiki. This will hopefully help you get started!
        
        Some further development notes can be found on the `wiki
        <http://github.com/jobovy/galpy/wiki/>`__. This includes a list of
        small and larger extensions of galpy that would be useful `here
        <http://github.com/jobovy/galpy/wiki/Possible-galpy-extensions>`__ as
        well as a longer-term roadmap `here
        <http://github.com/jobovy/galpy/wiki/Roadmap>`__. Please let the main
        developer know if you need any help contributing!
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        DISK DF CORRECTIONS
        --------------------
        
        The dehnendf and shudf disk distribution functions can be corrected to
        follow the desired surface-mass density and radial-velocity-dispersion
        profiles more closely (see `1999AJ....118.1201D
        <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1999AJ....118.1201D>`__). Calculating
        these corrections is expensive, and a large set of precalculated
        corrections can be found `here
        <http://github.com/downloads/jobovy/galpy/galpy-dfcorrections.tar.gz>`__
        \[tar.gz archive\]. Install these by downloading them and unpacking them into the galpy/df/data directory before running the setup.py installation. E.g.::
        
           curl -O https://github.s3.amazonaws.com/downloads/jobovy/galpy/galpy-dfcorrections.tar.gz
           tar xvzf galpy-dfcorrections.tar.gz -C ./galpy/df/data/
