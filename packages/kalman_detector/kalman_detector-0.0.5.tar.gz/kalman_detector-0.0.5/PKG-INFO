Description: This module implements the kalman detector score along with the equivalent cumulative fourier
               score. Score is designed to receive X(f), a sequence of "amplitudes" (where f is an arbitrary indexed parameter)
               and decide between: 
               H0: X(f) = N(f)  pure gaussian noise
               H1: X(f) = A(f) + N(f) where A(f) is a smooth gaussian field with a low-pass power spectra where the smoothness parameter
               unknown. 
               Was originally written for detecting Fast Radio Bursts, but can be used to many other types of signals including 
               AGN light curves.
