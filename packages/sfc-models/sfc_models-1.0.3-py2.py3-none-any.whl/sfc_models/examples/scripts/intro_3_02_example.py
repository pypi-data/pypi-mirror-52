# Step 1: Import modules
# sfc_models code objects. Using "from <module> import *" is frowned upon, but I wanted to
# have less lines of code for beginners to parse.
from sfc_models.objects import *
# Quick2DPlot() - Plotting functions used by examples; relies upon matplotlib
from sfc_models.examples.Quick2DPlot import Quick2DPlot

# Step 1.5: set up logging
# The next line of code sets the name of the output files based on the code file's name.
# This means that if you paste this code into a new file, get a new log name.
register_standard_logs('output', __file__)

# Step 2: build the model objects
# Create model, which holds all entities
mod = Model()
# Create first country - Canada. (This model only has one country.)
can = Country(mod, 'CA', 'Canada')
# Create sectors
gov = ConsolidatedGovernment(can, 'GOV', 'Government')
hh = Household(can, 'HH', 'Household')
# A literally non-profit business sector
bus = FixedMarginBusiness(can, 'BUS', 'Business Sector', profit_margin=0.0)
# Create the linkages between sectors - tax flow, markets - labour ('LAB'), goods ('GOOD')
tax = TaxFlow(can, 'TF', 'TaxFlow', .2)
labour = Market(can, 'LAB', 'Labour market')
goods = Market(can, 'GOOD', 'Goods market')
# Need to set the exogenous variable - Government demand for Goods ("G" in economist symbology)
mod.AddExogenous('GOV', 'DEM_GOOD', '[20.,] * 105')
# Step 3: Invoke the method ("main") that builds the model.
mod.main()

# Once the framework has built and solved the model equations, we can either work with the output files,
# or within Python. Here, we do a plot with Quick2DPlot.
mod.TimeSeriesCutoff = 20
time = mod.GetTimeSeries('k')
Y_SIM = mod.GetTimeSeries('GOOD__SUP_GOOD')
Quick2DPlot(time, Y_SIM, 'Output (Y) - Model SIM', filename='intro_3_02_Y.png')
