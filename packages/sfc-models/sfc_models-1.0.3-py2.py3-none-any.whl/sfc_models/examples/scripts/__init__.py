"""
sfc_models.examples.scripts

This package consists of a set of interactive example scripts, designed to be run as the entry point for
Python. If you import them, they will run automatically.

A script will be built to deploy these scripts to a more sensible location.

This package is obviously not going to be covered by unit tests.
