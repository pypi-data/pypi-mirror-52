"""
install_example_scripts.py

Run "install([path])" to install all of the example scripts into a directory.  If a file already exists, the
script throws an error. The user has to clean existing code out of the way, even if it is not modified.

This is somewhat clumsy, but this is a stop-gap installation measure. There is support for installation of
"data files" within the installation framework, but I want to make sure the users know where the
scripts are.
