Models from Chapter 3 of [G&L 2012].

- Model SIM = Simplest SFC Model
- Model SIMEX1 = Model SIM + Expectations. This version features expected income that is the previous period's
  realised income.

class SIMEX1(GL_book_model):
    """
    Implements the SIMEX model from Chapter 3 of G&L - Section 3.7.1.  SIMEX = "Model SIM (Simplest) with expectations."

    Household consumption is based on expected income, and not realised income. In this version of the model, expected
    income equals the previous period's income.

    (Another version of SIMEX within the book has expectations that do not change, hence this model is referred to as
    SIMEX1.)

    In order to replicate the book results, we need to patch in a value for the expected income for the first period.
    This is done by setting the after-tax income level for period 0.

    From page 81:
        Here things are much simpler. For instance, starting again from scratch,
        as we did with the numerical example of Table 3.4, we can suppose that, in
        the second period, households only expect as income the services purchased
        by government. [Brian R: This means that expected after tax income is $20 - $4 = $16.]

     passage.)I
