    Base class for example models from [G&L 2012] for single-country models.

        Constructor for an example model. Builds a single country, using a code that is passed in.

        If the user supplies an existing Model object, uses that. This allows us to embed in a multi-country model.

        Returns a list of expected output. Used to validate the framework output.
        Uses the default exogenous series.

        Format:
        A list of tuples, that consist of the variable name, and (limited) time series of output.
        For example:
        [
        ('GOOD_SUP_GOOD', [0., 10., 12.]),
        ('HH_AfterTax', [0., 15., 18., 22.]),
        ]
        In this case, the variable 'GOOD_SUP_GOOD' is expected to be [0., 10., 12.] for the first 3 periods
        and
        'HH_AftterTax' is expected to be [0., 15., 18., 22.] over the fiest 4 periods.

        In other words, target outputs do not have to be the same length.
