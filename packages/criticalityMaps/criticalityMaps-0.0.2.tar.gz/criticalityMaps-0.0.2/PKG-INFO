        CriticalityMaps
        ---------------
        CriticalityMaps is a [WNTR](https://github.com/USEPA/WNTR)-based utility for running large sets of 
        fire and pipe criticality simulations and visualizing the results on interactive leaflet.js html 
        maps. Additionally, the mapping utilities can be used to visualize any other attributes of the 
        network on an interactive .html map.
