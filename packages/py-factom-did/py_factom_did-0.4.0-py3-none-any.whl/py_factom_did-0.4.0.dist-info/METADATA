# py-factom-did

py-factom-did is a Python library, allowing the creation and update of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and
the exporting of public metadata for them, which can be recorded on the Factom blockchain.
The library enables:

* creating a new DID
* adding management key(s) for the DID
* adding DID key(s) for the DID
* adding service(s) for the DID
* exporting public metadata to be recorded on Factom
* encrypting the newly created keys
* updating an existing DID: adding/revoking management keys, DID keys and services and producing a signed DID
update entry

You can find an example of the library workflow in the `examples/` directory. In order to run the
example, please note that it is necessary to:

* have local instances of `factomd` and `factom-walletd` running
* create an environment variable called `EC_ADDR`, which contains a funded EC
address to pay the fees for recording the DID on-chain

## Installation
```
pip install py-factom-did
```

## Build

* Clone the repo

* Create the virtual environment and install the dependencies:
```
pipenv install
```
