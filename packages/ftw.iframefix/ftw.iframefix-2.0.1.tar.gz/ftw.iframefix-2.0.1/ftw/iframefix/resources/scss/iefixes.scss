/*
  Video- and iFrame-blocks contain iframes. Internet Explorer and Edge are not able to handle
  pointer events properly on iframes. This means that all events are not propagated up through
  the iframe. This causes the simplelayout toolbar to stay invisible. So disable pointer events
  on Video- and iFrame-blocks. This way the user is able to edit these blocks but unable to interact
  with the iframe itself.
  IE10 and older MS browsers don't know pointer-events, so this selector won't work for them.
