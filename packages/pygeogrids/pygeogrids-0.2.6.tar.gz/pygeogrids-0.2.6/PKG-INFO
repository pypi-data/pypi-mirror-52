        This is a package for creation and handling of Discrete Global Grids or Point
        collections. We hope extend the interface also to projected grids(images) in the
        future.

        If you use the software in a publication then please cite it using the Zenodo DOI.
        Be aware that this badge links to the latest package version.
        
        Please select your specific version at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.596401 to get the DOI of that version.
        You should normally always use the DOI for the specific version of your record in citations.
        This is to ensure that other researchers can access the exact research artefact you used for reproducibility.

        Installation
        ============
        
        This package should be installable through pip:
        
        .. code::
        
            pip install pygeogrids
        
        To install the package use pip 6.0 or later. On linux systems `pykdtree
        <https://github.com/storpipfugl/pykdtree>`__ will be installed whereas on
        windows systems `scipy <http://www.scipy.org/>`__ ``cKDTree`` will be used.
        pykdtree is faster than the scipy implementation but it is at the moment
        not available for Windows systems.
        
        Features
        ========
        
        For now the main features are:
        
        -  Creation of grids
        -  Nearest neighbor search
        -  conversion of grid piont indices to lat, lon
        -  Storage of grids and loading grids from CF-compatible netCDF files
        -  Calculation of lookup tables between grids
        -  Support for different Geodetic Datums using pyproj.
        
        Contribute
        ==========
        
        We are happy if you want to contribute. Please raise an issue explaining what
        is missing or if you find a bug. We will also gladly accept pull requests
        against our master branch for new features or bug fixes.
        
        Development setup
        -----------------
        
        For Development we recommend a ``conda`` environment. You can create one
        including test dependencies and debugger by running
        ``conda env create -f environment.yml``. This will create a new ``pygeogrids``
        environment which you can activate by using ``source activate pygeogrids``.
        
        Guidelines
        ----------
        
        If you want to contribute please follow these steps:
        
        - Fork the pygeogrids repository to your account
        - Clone the repository
        - make a new feature branch from the pygeogrids master branch
        - Add your feature
        - Please include tests for your contributions in one of the test directories.
          We use py.test so a simple function called test_my_feature is enough
        - submit a pull request to our master branch
