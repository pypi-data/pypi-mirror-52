The extracellular Wnt signal stimulates several intra-cellular signal transduction cascades. The three best-characterized WNT pathways are shown: the canonical or Wnt/Beta-catenin dependent pathway and the non-canonical or Beta-catenin-independent pathway, that can be divided into the Planar Cell Polarity pathway, which is prominently involved in the regulation of cell polarity, cell motility and morphogenetic movements; and the Wnt/Ca2+ pathway, which regulates the transcription of genes controlling cell fate and cell migration. <p></p><h6><b>Node Legend:</b></h6><div>Green circle &gt; Protein or Fusion Protein</div><div>White circle &gt; Protein Family</div><div>Large purple circle &gt; Complex</div><div>Beige square &gt; Chemical</div><div>Yellow square &gt; Small Molecule</div><div>Red diamond &gt; miRNA</div><div>Green rectangle &gt; Phenotype</div><div>Pink rectangle &gt; Stimulus</div><div>Rounded orange square &gt; Non human</div><h6><b>Edge Legend:</b></h6><div>Solid line &gt; Direct</div><div>Dashed line &gt; Indirect or Unknown</div><div>Blue &gt; Up-regulation</div><div>Red &gt; Down-regulation</div><div>Green &gt; Form complex</div><div>Dark grey &gt; Unknown</div>"}, {"n":"rightsHolder","v":"Prof. Gianni Cesareni"}, {"n":"rights","v":"Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0)"}, {"n":"reference","v":"<div>Perfetto L., <i>et al.</i></div><div><b>SIGNOR: a database of causal relationships between biological entities</b><i>.</i></div><div>Nucleic Acids Res. 2016 Jan 4;44(D1):D548-54</div><div><span><a href=\"\\&#34;https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkv1048\\&#34;\" target=\"\\&#34;\\&#34;\">doi: 10.1093/nar/gkv1048</a></span></div>"}, {"n":"dataSource","v":"https://signor.uniroma2.it/pathway_browser.php?organism=&pathway_list=SIGNOR-WNT"}, {"n":"version","v":"18-Jan-2019"}, {"n":"organism","v":"Human, 9606, Homo sapiens"}, {"n":"networkType","v":"Signalling Pathway"}]},
