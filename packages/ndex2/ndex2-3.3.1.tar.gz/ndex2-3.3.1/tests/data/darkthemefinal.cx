The binding of extracellular ligands (EGF) induces homo and heterodimerization, transphosphorylation and activation of four ErbB family receptors: EGFR (ErbB1), ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4. These events trigger a cascade of activation of downstream pathways that include, principally, the MAPK, Akt and JNK pathways, culminating in DNA synthesis and cell proliferation. <p></p><h6><b>Node Legend:</b></h6><div>Green circle &gt; Protein or Fusion Protein</div><div>White circle &gt; Protein Family</div><div>Large purple circle &gt; Complex</div><div>Beige square &gt; Chemical</div><div>Yellow square &gt; Small Molecule</div><div>Red diamond &gt; miRNA</div><div>Green rectangle &gt; Phenotype</div><div>Pink rectangle &gt; Stimulus</div><div>Rounded orange square &gt; Non human</div><h6><b>Edge Legend:</b></h6><div>Solid line &gt; Direct</div><div>Dashed line &gt; Indirect or Unknown</div><div>Blue &gt; Up-regulation</div><div>Red &gt; Down-regulation</div><div>Green &gt; Form complex</div><div>Dark grey &gt; Unknown</div>"}, {"n":"version","v":"18-Jan-2019"}, {"n":"labels","v":["SIGNOR-EGF"],"d":"list_of_string"}, {"n":"reference","v":"<div>Perfetto L., <i>et al.</i></div><div><b>SIGNOR: a database of causal relationships between biological entities</b><i>.</i></div><div>Nucleic Acids Res. 2016 Jan 4;44(D1):D548-54</div><div><span><a href=\"\\&#34;https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkv1048\\&#34;\" target=\"\\&#34;\\&#34;\">doi: 10.1093/nar/gkv1048</a></span></div>"}, {"n":"rights","v":"Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0)"}, {"n":"name","v":"Dark theme final version"}, {"n":"networkType","v":"Signalling Pathway"}, {"n":"dataSource","v":"https://signor.uniroma2.it/pathway_browser.php?organism=&pathway_list=SIGNOR-EGF"}]},
