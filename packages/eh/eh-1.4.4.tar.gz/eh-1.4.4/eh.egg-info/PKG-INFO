Description: # Eh
        
        Eh is a tool to give quick help on a particular subject
        
        The source code can be found at:
        
        ```
        https://github.com/roaet/eh
        ```
        
        ## Installing
        
        Install with `pip install eh`. You may want to use `sudo` if you want it
        available everywhere.
        
        With some versions of linux it will install it into `~/.local/bin` when you
        do not use `sudo`. Ensure that this directory is in your `PATH` if you want to
        run eh.
        
        ## Eh Configuration File
        
        The Eh configuration file is located at ~/.eh/eh.ini. This location cannot be
        changed.
        
        ## Making an eh topic
        
        You can make a new eh topic by:
        
        - contributing to the subject repo at `https://github.com/roaet/eh_subjects`
        - creating your own repo and including it in your eh.ini
        
        ### Creating a new subject repo
        
        When you add it to your eh.ini you must provide the entire URI. The value on
        the left-hand side of the `=` does not matter as long as it is unique to your
        configuration file.
        
        ## Auto Complete
        
        (shoutout to https://github.com/CarvellScott/completion_utils for the help)
        
        After installing you can add eh bash completion by running: `complete -C eh_autocomplete eh`
        
        ## Future features
        
        - Config from home for color options
        - Adding support for `https://github.com/rstacruz/cheatsheets` format
