Description: 
        # code  
          
        This repo holds a variety of tools in support of the GDA Score Project (General Data Anonymity Score Project).  
          
        The code here is still very much alpha, and little effort has gone into making it easy for others to install and use.  
          
        The primary language is Python, and requires Python3.7 or later. API documentation for some of the tools can be found at https://gda-score.github.io/.  
          
        ## To run  
          
        There are 2 possible ways of using this program:  
          
        1. #### Installing via `pip`:  
           - step 1: `$ pip install gda-score-code`  
                  
           - step 2: if you would like to stick to default configuration then skip this step. otherwise try executing `$ gdascore_init` in your console  to modify the configuration.  
          
           - step 3: use following import statements in your code:  
        	   ```python  
        	   from gdascore.gdaScore import gdaAttack, gdaScores  
        	   from gdascore.gdaUtilities import *
        	   from gdascore.gdaQuery import *
        	   ```  
          
        2. #### Cloning the repository:  
          
           This repo has executable .py files in a variety of locations, most notably ./attacks and ./utility.  
          
           There are libraries and configuration files located under ./common.  
          
           To run these executables, the environment variable `PYTHONPATH` must be set to the path to the repo. (For example,      `PYTHONPATH=C:\Users\francis\Documents\GitHub\code;`)
