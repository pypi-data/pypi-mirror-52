Description: GraphDash
        =========
        
        ``GraphDash`` is a web-based dashboard built on graphs and their
        metadata. For example, if you have two graphs in a directory:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ cd default_graph_dir
            $ ls
            graph.svg graph2.svg
        
        Then you can create two metadata files using YAML format, where you can
        configure how the graphs will be displayed:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ cat graph.yaml
            name: graph.svg
            family: 'Category 1'
            title: '*Real serious* graph'
            text: |
                The description
        
            $ cat graph2.yaml
            name: graph2.svg
            family: 'Category 2'
            title: 'Another important graph'
        
        You may then start the graph dashboard. You will get a nice web
        interface displaying your graphs, and a search box with autocompletion.
        You can easily navigate and share your graphs.
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ GraphDash --root .
            * Running on http://0.0.0.0:5555/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
        
        .. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmadeusITGroup/GraphDash/master/docs/example.gif
           :alt: 
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Clone and install (in user space):
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            git clone https://github.com/AmadeusITGroup/graphdash.git
            cd graphdash
            pip install --user .
        
        Or use the Python package:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            pip install --user graphdash
        
        Launch the webapp
        -----------------
        
        For user-space installation, make sure your ``$PATH`` includes
        ``~/.local/bin``.
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ GraphDash -r default_graph_dir
            * Running on http://0.0.0.0:5555/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
        
        The dashboard can be configured with a YAML config file and the
        ``-c/--conf`` option:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ cat docs/graphdash.yaml
            root: ../default_graph_dir
            title: "Example of title ;)"
            subtitle: "Example of subtitle"
        
            $ GraphDash -c docs/graphdash.yaml
            * Running on http://0.0.0.0:5555/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
        
        You can generate a template of configuration file:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ GraphDash -C template.yaml
        
        Serve with Gunicorn
        -------------------
        
        If not already installed on your machine, install ``Gunicorn``:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            pip install --user gunicorn setproctitle  # on Fedora you may need to install libffi-devel before
        
        Since you can import the webapp through ``graphdash:app``, you can serve
        it with ``Gunicorn``:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            gunicorn -b 0.0.0.0:8888 --pid server.pid graphdash:app
        
        The configuration file of the webapp can be set with the ``CONF``
        environment variable. With ``Gunicorn``, you can pass environment
        variables to the workers with ``--env``:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            gunicorn -b 0.0.0.0:8888 --pid server.pid --env CONF=docs/graphdash.yaml graphdash:app
        
        But you should *not* use these commands yourself, that is what
        ``GraphDashManage`` is for!
        
        GraphDashManage
        ---------------
        
        ``GraphDashManage`` is used to ``start``, ``stop``, ``restart`` the
        instances of ``Gunicorn`` serving ``graphdash:app``. It needs a
        configuration file in the current directory:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ cat settings.sh
            ALL_MODES=(
               ['prod']="docs/graphdash.yaml"
               ['test']="docs/graphdash.yaml"
            )
            ALL_PORTS=(
               ['prod']=1234
               ['test']=5678
            )
            WORKERS=3
        
        Then you can manage multiple instances of ``GraphDash`` using
        ``Gunicorn`` with:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ GraphDashManage start prod
            [INFO] Listening at: http://0.0.0.0:1234
            [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 30403
            [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 30404
            [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 30405
        
            $ GraphDashManage start test
            [INFO] Listening at: http://0.0.0.0:5678
            ...
        
        You can generate a template of settings:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ GraphDashManage template > template.sh # to be moved to settings.sh
        
        Webapp configuration file
        -------------------------
        
        Possible entries (everything is optional):
        
        -  ``root``: the root directory of the graphs
        -  ``families``: path to the families metadata file (optional)
        -  ``title``: the title of the webapp
        -  ``subtitle``: the subtitle of the webapp
        -  ``placeholder``: the default text in the search field
        -  ``header``: an optional message at the top (markdown syntax)
        -  ``footer``: an optional message at the bottom (markdown syntax)
        -  ``showfamilynumbers``: a boolean to toggle family numbering (default
           is true)
        -  ``showgraphnumbers``: a boolean to toggle graph numbering (default is
           true)
        -  ``theme``: change css theme (default is dark)
        -  ``keep``: the proportion of common words kept for autocompletion
        -  ``logfile``: change default log file of the webapp
        -  ``raw``: when loading, look for all graphs and ignore metadata
        -  ``verbose``: a boolean indicating verbosity when loading application
        -  ``debug``: debug mode (enable Grunt livereload, enable Flask debug
           mode)
        -  ``headless``: headless mode (only search is available, no page is
           rendered)
        -  ``port``: when launched with Flask development server only, port
        
        Graph metadata
        --------------
        
        Several attributes are supported:
        
        -  ``name``: the path to the graph
        -  ``title``: title of the graph, recommended for display purposes
           (markdown syntax)
        -  ``family``: the subsection in which the graph is
        -  ``index``: an optional list of keywords describing the graph (useful
           for search feature)
        -  ``text``: an optional description of the graph (markdown syntax)
        -  ``pretext``: an optional message appearing before the graph (markdown
           syntax)
        -  ``file``: optional path to the raw data
        -  ``export``: optional path to the exportable graph (for example, a PNG
           file)
        -  ``rank``: integer, optional value used to change graphs order
           (default uses titles)
        -  ``showtitle``: a boolean to toggle title display for the graph
           (default is false)
        -  ``labels``: a list of labels (like ``'new'``) which will be rendered
           in the UI as colored circles
        -  ``other``: other metadata not used by ``GraphDash``, but may be
           needed by other things reading the metadata
        
        Note that if the ``name`` attribute is missing, the graph will not be
        shown and the text will be displayed anyway, like a blog entry.
        
        Family metadata
        ---------------
        
        You may put a ``.FAMILIES.yaml`` file at the root of the graph
        directory. This file may contain metadata for families. It should be a
        YAML list:
        
        .. code:: yaml
        
            - family: chairs
              rank : 0
            - family: tables
              rank : 1
              text: This is a description
              alias: This text will appear instead of "tables"
              labels: new
        
        Each element of the list should be a dict containing:
        
        -  ``family``: the family considered
        -  ``rank``: integer, optional value used to change families order
           (default uses family name)
        -  ``text``: an optional description of the family (markdown syntax)
        -  ``alias``: an optional name who may be longer than the one in the url
           (useful to build nice urls)
        -  ``labels``: a list of labels (like ``new``) which will be rendered in
           the UI as colored circles
        
        Available labels are ``new``, ``update``, ``bugfix``, ``warning``,
        ``error``, ``ongoing``, ``obsolete``. You may give other labels which
        will be rendered with defaults colors. For customization, you may
        specify your own labels with a dict syntax:
        
        .. code:: yaml
        
            labels:
            - name: newlabel
              color: white
              text_color: black
              text: "NEW LABEL"
              tooltip: null
        
        Development
        -----------
        
        If you wish to contribute, you need ``Grunt`` to generate new css/js
        files from sass/coffee source files.
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            npm install --no-bin-links # may need to repeat
            grunt
        
        Debugging can be made with source map files for browser supporting them
        in their debugging tools. If not, the ``Gruntfile.js`` enables an option
        to generate non-minified assets.
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            grunt --dev
        
        With the ``debug`` mode enabled, Grunt will use the livereload mechanism
        to reload the browser if any file has changed (and Flask debug mode will
        reload the server as well).
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            GraphDash --debug & # or python -m graphdash
            grunt watch
        
        If you used ``Gunicorn`` with a PID file, Grunt will automatically
