Description: # Supercontest Client
        
        I have chosen to enable GraphiQL on [southbaysupercontest](https://southbaysupercontest.com) because it is protected
        by auth and CSRF. It's a valuable tool for users. [You may explore the data here](https://southbaysupercontest.com/graphql).
        
        There is a Python client to fetch your data programmatically, similar to gql. Simply
        `pip install supercontest` and then run a query like the following example:
        
        ```python
        import supercontest
        
        query = """
        {
          users (filters: {email_confirmed_at_lt: "2019-10-01T00:00:00"}) {
            edges {
              node {
                email
                first_name
              }
            }
          }
        }
        """
        
        data = supercontest.query(email='myemail@domain.com',
                                  password='mypassword',  # your pw is encrypted over https
                                  query=query)
        ```
        
        Other heavy-handed solutions like Selenium also work. The endpoint simply requires
        auth and a CSRF token.
