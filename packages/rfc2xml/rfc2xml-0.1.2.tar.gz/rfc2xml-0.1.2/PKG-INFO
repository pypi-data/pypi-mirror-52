Description: # rfc2xml
        Tool to process an RFC or Internet Standard into XML. Structure can also be accessed directly within a seperate Python project.
        
        Note that this is not a general purpose tool and contains some restrictions. This is currently really slow. This is due partly to to overhead from Python, the parsing library and some inefficient parser grammar.
        
        ## Usage
        ```bash
        python -m rfc2xml <filename> [--suppress-result]
        ```
        
        ## Examples
        Download an Internet Standard to process:
        ```bash
        wget https://www.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-quic-transport-19.txt
        ```
        
        The tool can then be run on that file using the following command (in the top level src directory):
        ```bash
        python -m rfc2xml draft-ietf-quic-transport-19.txt
        ```
        
        ## Import
        The tool can also be imported into a different python script and used there:
        
        ```python
        from rfc2xml import Rfc2Xml
        with open("draft-ietf-quic-transport-19.txt") as fp:
            contents = fp.read()
        dom = Rfc2Xml.parse(contents)
        ```
