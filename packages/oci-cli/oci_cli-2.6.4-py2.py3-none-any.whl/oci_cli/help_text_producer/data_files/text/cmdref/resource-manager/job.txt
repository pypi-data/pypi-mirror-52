job
***


Description
===========

Jobs perform the actions that are defined in your configuration. There
are three job types - **Plan job**. A plan job takes your Terraform
configuration, parses it, and creates an execution plan. - **Apply
job**. The apply job takes your execution plan, applies it to the
associated stack, then executes the configuration's instructions. -
**Destroy job**. To clean up the infrastructure controlled by the
stack, you run a destroy job. A destroy job does not delete the stack
or associated job resources, but instead releases the resources
managed by the stack.
