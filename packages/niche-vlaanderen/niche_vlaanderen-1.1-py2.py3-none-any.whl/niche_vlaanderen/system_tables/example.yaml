# Niche Vlaanderen configuration file
#
# input_layers take the values for every input of the niche model. It is
# possible to specify a grid file or directory, or to specify a constant number
#
# Files can be specified using absolute or relative paths.
# eg:
#   soil_code: c:\project\dijle\mhw.tif
#
# Relative paths are relative to the configuration file path.
#
# Different grid types are supported. Recommended types are geotiff (.tif) and
# .asc (which is human readable).
#
# Arcgis grid sets can be specified using their directory or one of the .adf
# files below them.
# eg:
#   mlw: c:\project\niche\TestCase_GroteNete\InputSnapBodem\dd2_glg
# or:
#   mlw: c:\project\niche\TestCase_GroteNete\InputSnapBodem\dd2_glg\w001001.adf
#
# More information on the different options are explained in the documentation:
# https://inbo.github.io/niche_vlaanderen/cli.html


# model_options sets the options for running the model. The only required field
# is output_dir. The other options are optional and will use default values
# if not defined.
#

model_options:
  # output_dir: directory to which the model output files have to be written.
  output_dir: _output
  # simple_model: default is False. If true only mhw, mlw and soil_code are
  # used for prediction.
  simple_model: False
  # deviation: default is False. Create maps on the deviation between the niche
  # required mhw/mlw and the actual mhw/mlw.
  deviation: True
  # abiotic: default is False. Use abiotic values specified for the Full model
  # rather than calculating them.
  abiotic: False
  # strict_checks: default is True. Validate that no invalid combinations
  # of MHW, MLW and MSW occur.
  strict_checks: True
  # name: you can specify a name for the model. This name will be added to
  # the output files and will be used when plotting/comparing results.
  name: example
  # overwrite_files: by default Niche will not write any file if a file
  # with the same name already exists.
  overwrite_files: True

input_layers:
  # These three input layers always have to be defined
  soil_code: data/small/soil_code.asc
  mhw: data/small/mhw.asc
  mlw: data/small/mlw.asc
  # These input layers have to be defined when running a full model
  # When running a simple model they can be omitted.
  # note that instead of a full grid a constant value can be given
