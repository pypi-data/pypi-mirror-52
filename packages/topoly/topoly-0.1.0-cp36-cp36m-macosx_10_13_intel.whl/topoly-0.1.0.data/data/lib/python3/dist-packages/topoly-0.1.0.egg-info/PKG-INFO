Description: ## Requirements
        - cmake 3.8 or later**
        - make
        - CUDA toolkit - nvidia-toolkit (nvcc CUDA compiler)
        - gcc 4.8 or later
        - boost 1.50-1.65
        - Python 3 (3.4 or later)
        - Cython 0.26 or later - use "pip3 install Cython" to install
        - Xcode 9.4 or OLDER (on Mac OS X - Nvidia does not support newer Xcode)
        
        ** You can download binary distributions of cmake from: https://cmake.org/download/
        Just unzip and add the cmake-XXX/bin to the PATH, for example:
        
        `export PATH=~/cmake-3.13.0-Linux-x86_64/bin:$PATH`
        
        ## Build and test C++ code
        1. Setup the build directory:
        
        ``mkdir build && cd build && cmake ..``
        2. Build the binaries:
        ``make``
        3. Run the tests*
        ``make test``
        
        * The build may be done on a computer without a CUDA supported GPU provided that the nvidia-toolkit is installed.
        The knotnet tests, however, will require a CUDA supported GPU to pass.
        
        * if tests fail you can look into `build/Testing/Temporary` for details.
        
        ## Generate distribution
        After building in the `build` directory run:
        
        ``make package``
        
        This will produce 3 distribution packages:
        - ZIP package
        - DEB package for Debian and Ubuntu
        - RPM package for RedHat, Scientific Linux and CentOS
        
        ## Generate Python Package for PIP
        
        1. In the main folder run:
        
        ``python3 setup.py bdist_wheel``
        2. The output should be a wheel (whl) package located in:
        ``dist``
        3. If you want to clean and rebuild the package delete the directory
        ``rm -rf _skbuild``
        
        ## Documentation:
        
        See ``topoly\graph.py`` and ``topoly\doc_example.py``
        
        Generate API documentation as HTML:
        
        1. ``sudo apt install doxygen graphviz``
        2. ``cd topoly``
        3. ``doxygen topoly.doc.cfg`` or run ``doxygen.sh``
        4. The API documentation will be generated to ``topoly-web\api``
        
        
        ## Readme for the end user is located in docs/README.md
