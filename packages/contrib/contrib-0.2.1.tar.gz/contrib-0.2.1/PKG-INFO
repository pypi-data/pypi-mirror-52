        A python package for making stacked area plots of contributions to a git
        repository over time.  Plots can show contributions by authors, or by
        organizations.

        ## Installation
        
        `contrib` is on PyPI, so you can just `pip install` it:
        
        ```console
        $ pip install contrib
        ```
        
        Alternately, you can clone this project, add its directory to your
        `PYTHONPATH`, and add the `bin` directory to your `PATH`.
        
        ## Usage
        
        To use `contrib`, you'll need to create a configuration file telling it
        where to find your code.  Below is an example for Spack; you can find
        complete code in the
        [spack-contributions](https://github.com/spack/spack-contributions) repo.
        
        ```yaml
        contrib:
          # Path to your git repository. to run git blame on.
          # Consider making this a git submodule.
          repo:   ./spack
        
          # JSON file mapping authors to organizations (optional)
          orgmap: ./author-to-org.json
        
          # Separate parts of the repository to process (optional).  For each
          # commit, Spack looks for files that match the patterns in each part.
          # For a simple repo, you may only need one regular expression per part.
          # In Spack, the packages have moved around in the repo over time so we
          # provide multiple patterns.
          parts:
            packages:
              - ^var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/.*\.py$
              - ^var/spack/packages/.*\.py$
              - ^lib/spack/spack/packages/.*\.py$
        ```
        
        The `repo` needs to be in your local filesystem.
        
        ### Mapping authors to organizations
        `author-to-org.json` is optional.  If you choose to provide it, it should
        be simple `json` dictionary mapping authors to organizations:
        
        ```json
        {
          "Author 1": "UIUC",
          "Author 2": "LBL",
          ...
          "Author N": "LLNL"
        }
        ```
        
        You can run `contrib --update-org-map` to look at your repository's
        history and generate this file automatically.
        
        ### Running
        
        Once you've got all of that set up, you can run `contrib` in the
        directory where `contrib.yaml` lives:
        
        ```console
        $ ls
        author-to-org.json  contrib.yaml
        $ contrib
        ==> Indexing 49 commits.
        
        STARTED       0/49 53ab298e88f80454f7f7c20ef200a3dbd0870473
            packages: processed 45/3487 blames (9.04/s)
        ...
        ```
        
        By default, `contrib` will sample 50 commits from your repository and
        plot them.  If you want it to plot fewer samples, you can run `contrib
        --samples SAMPLES` where `SAMPLES` is a number of your choosing.
        `contrib` tries to use the available processors on the machine it is
        run, and by default it will run parallel `git blame` jobs.  You can
        control the parallelism with the `--jobs JOBS` argument.
        
        `contrib` has to run `git blame` for each sampled commit and for each
        file in the `parts` section of your `contrib.yaml` file (or for all files
        if `parts` is not provided), so it can take a long time to run if your
        repo's history is long.  `contrib`'s output shows how many `git blame`
        calls remain and how fast blames are currently completing.
        
        ### Cached data
        
        `contrib` caches results of `git blame` in a directory called
        `line-data`.  For large repositories, this can get to be quite large, so
        make sure you have a decent amount of space available (gigabytes for
        large repositories).
