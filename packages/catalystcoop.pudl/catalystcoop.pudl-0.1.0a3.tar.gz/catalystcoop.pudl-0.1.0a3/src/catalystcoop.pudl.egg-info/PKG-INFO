        `PUDL <https://catalyst.coop/pudl/>`__ makes US energy data easier to access
        and work with. Hundreds of gigabytes of supposedly public information published
        by government agencies, but in a bunch of different formats that can be hard to
        work with and combine. PUDL takes these spreadsheets, CSV files, and databases
        and turns them into easy to parse, well-documented
        `tabular data packages <https://https://frictionlessdata.io/docs/tabular-data-package/>`__
        that can be used to create a database, used directly with Python, R, Microsoft
        Access, and lots of other tools.
        
        The project currently contains data from:
        
        * `EIA Form 860 <https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/eia860/>`__
        * `EIA Form 923 <https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/eia923/>`__
        * `The EPA Continuous Emissions Monitoring System (CEMS) <https://ampd.epa.gov/ampd/>`__
        * `The EPA Integrated Planning Model (IPM) <https://www.epa.gov/airmarkets/national-electric-energy-data-system-needs-v6>`__
        * `FERC Form 1 <https://www.ferc.gov/docs-filing/forms/form-1/data.asp>`__
        
        We are especially interested in serving researchers, activists, journalists,
        and policy makers that might not otherwise be able to afford access to this
        data from commercial data providers.
        
        Getting Started TEMPORARILY OUT OF DATE
        ---------------------------------------
        
        Just want to play with some example data? Install
        `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/>`__
        (or `miniconda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`__
        if you like the command line) with at least Python 3.7. Then run the following
        commands in your terminal:
        
        **NOTE: (2019-09-03)** this next code block won't work unless you have the old
        PostgreSQL PUDL database set up. We are in the process of deprecating that
        database, and using tabular datapackages that feed into SQLite instead.
        However, the code is temporarily out of sync with the docs. The last version of
        the guide to setting up the PostgreSQL database can be found in
        `this commit <https://github.com/catalyst-cooperative/pudl/blob/a8173bd78857d4a09ddf685b19fea0a83f2e5007/docs/getting_started.md#4-install-and-configure-postgresql>`__ if you need to get it set up in the interim.
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ git clone https://github.com/catalyst-cooperative/pudl.git
            $ conda env create --name pudl --file pudl/environment.yml
            $ conda activate pudl
            $ pip install -e pudl
            $ mkdir pudl-work
            $ pudl_setup --pudl_in=pudl-work --pudl_out=pudl-work
            $ pudl_data --sources eia923 eia860 ferc1 epacems epaipm --years 2017 --states id
            $ pudl_etl pudl-work/settings/pudl_etl_example.yml
            $ jupyter-lab --notebook-dir=pudl_workspace/notebooks
        
        This will install the PUDL Python package, create some local directories
        inside a directory called ``pudl-work``, download the most recent year of
        data from the public agencies, load it into a local PostgreSQL database,
        and open up a folder with some example `Jupyter noteboooks <https://jupyter.org>`__
        in your web browser.
        
        We are transitioning to generating CSV/JSON based
        `tabular data packages <https://frictionlessdata.io/docs/tabular-data-package/>`__,
        which are then loaded into a local SQLite database to make setting up PUDL
        easier.
        
        **NOTE:** The example above requires a computer with at least **4 GB of RAM**
        and **several GB of free disk space**. You will also need to download about
        **500 MB of data**. This could take a while if you have a slow internet
        connection.

        <https://catalystcoop-pudl.readthedocs.io/>`__.

        About Catalyst Cooperative
        --------------------------
        
        `Catalyst Cooperative <https://catalyst.coop>`__ is a small group of data
        scientists and policy wonks. We’re organized as a worker-owned cooperative
        consultancy. Our goal is a more just, livable, and sustainable world. We
        integrate public data and perform custom analyses to inform public policy
        making. Our focus is primarily on mitigating climate change and improving
        electric utility regulation in the United States.
        
        Do you work on renewable energy or climate policy? Have you found yourself
        scraping data from government PDFs, spreadsheets, websites, and databases,
        without getting something reusable? We build tools to pull this kind of
        information together reliably and automatically so you can focus on your real
        work instead — whether that’s political advocacy, energy journalism, academic
        research, or public policy making.
