Description: # Woah
        
        Woah is a script that you can wrap commands with, and it will wait until the
        load average is reasonable before running them.
        
        # Usage
        
        Similar to `nice`, you just start your command with `woah` and everything after
        that will be run unchanged.
        
        Say, if you have a lot of other things going on, and want your backup to wait
        for things to settle down...
        
        ```
        woah tar -xvzf /tmp/foo.tar users/tim
        ```
        
        Or you're running multiple things with xargs, but some are more expensive than
        others and you want to keep your machine somewhat responsive...
        
        ```
        (cd /users; ls -d *) | xargs -P32 -n1 --no-run-if-empty woah tar /tmp/{} /users/{}
        ```
