## Acknowledgement
 - Interactive shell: [python-nubia](https://github.com/facebookincubator/python-nubia)
 - [Web3.py](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.py/)



## TODO:
 - Fix `Verbose` Status bar (It does not change from `OFF`)
 - Print Accounts in `getnodeinfo` in a better format (One per line)
 - A way to reinitiate w3 (web3) by setting it to new host (right now it works for sethost but getnodeinfo still uses the first initiated w3)
 - add way more functionalities
