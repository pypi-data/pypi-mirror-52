        A simple but powerful templating language for text interpolation inspired by sas macros.
        
        ## How it works
        
        **Sassy** is a command-line program that **interpolates text** by interpreting a set of pre-defined **tags** that control text replacement, and loops, amongst other things.
        - A tag starts with a `%` and ends with a `;`.
        - Everything that is not a tag, or within open/close tags is interpreted as plaintext and is left untouched.
        
        Below is a description of each tag, with examples.
        
        ### Macros
        - Macros are named blocks of text enclosed within `%macro` and `%mend` tags, that are interpolated when executed. A macro can be executed at any point after it is defined
        
        - A macro looks a lot like a function, and must be given a name and a list of parameters within parentheses (empty for no parameters): `%macro <name>(<param>, ...);`
        
        - Macros are executed with the `%exec` tag, referencing the macro name, and passing the required parameters (if any)
        
        - When run, macros will interpolate parameters and tags within it's body, and output the resulting string
        
        - Macros currently accept a maximum number of 25 parameters
        
        ***test.txt***
        ```    
        %macro testMacro(param1);
            this text will show whenever the macro is called.
            we can reference macro parameters like this: &param1.
        %mend;
        
        here's how you call a macro:
        %exec testMacro(1);
        
        here's a call to the same macro with a different parameter:
        %exec testMacro(a parameter can contain spaces);
        ```
        
        Running `sassy test.txt` will generate the following... 
        
        ```
        Here's how you execute a macro:
            This text will be interpolated whenever the macro is executed.
            We can reference macro parameters like this: 1
        
        Here's a call to the same macro with a different parameter:
            This text will be interpolated whenever the macro is executed.
            We can reference macro parameters like this: a parameter can contain spaces
        ```
        
        
        ### Variables
        - Variables are named references to strings, which can be used within macros, and loop blocks
        
        - Variables are declared using the `%let` tag, as follows: `%let <name> = <value>;`
        
        - The value is includes everything after the equal symbol `=`
        
        - Variables can be referenced by wrapping the variable name within `&` and `.`, e.g. `&<name>.`
        
        - Macro parameters are referenced in the same way as variables, `&<param>.`
        
        - Variables references can be nested (see example below)
        
        ***test.txt***
        ```
        %let var1 = some value;
        %let var2 = some other value;
        %let varNum =2;
        
        %macro testMacro(param1);
            Here's how you reference variables: &var1.
            Macro parameters are referenced in the same way as variables: &param1.
            Variables and parameters can be nested to dynamically compose references to other variables: &var&varNum..
        %mend;
        
        Here's what that looks like:
        %exec testMacro(1);
        
        %exec testMacro(2);
        ```
        
        Running `sassy test.txt` will generate the following... 
        ``` 
        Here's what that looks like:
            Here's how you reference variables:  some value
            Macro parameters are referenced in the same way as variables: 1
            Variables and parameters can be nested to dynamically compose references to other variables:  some other value
        
            Here's how you reference variables:  some value
            Macro parameters are referenced in the same way as variables: 2
            Variables and parameters can be nested to dynamically compose references to other variables:  some other value
        ```
        
        
        ### Loops
        - Loops are blocks of text enclosed within `%procloop` and `%pend` tags, that are interpolated multiple times in succession
        
        - Unlike macros, loops do not have names and are interpolated in-place
        
        - A loop is declared as follows: `%procloop (<integer>) <counter_name>;`
            - `<integer>` - Defines the number of times the loop will execute. This can also be a reference to a variable
            - `<counter_name>` - Is a name given to the loop counter, that can be referenced within the loop body as a variable
        
        - The loop counter is zero-based
        
        
        ***test.txt***
        ```
        This is how you execute a loop:
        %procloop (3) loopCounter;
            This loop will execute &loopCounter. times.
        %pend;
        
        You can also use a variable to set the number of iterations:
        %let loopVar0 = first loop;
        %let loopVar1 = second loop;
        %let loopVar2 = third loop;
        %let loopVar3 = fourth loop;
        %let numLoops = 4;
        %procloop (&numLoops.) counterVar;
            This other loop will execute &counterVar. times, and references a different variable each time: &loopVar&counterVar..
        %pend;
        ```
        
        Running `sassy test.txt` will generate the following... 
        ```
        This is how you execute a loop:
            This loop will execute 0 times.
            This loop will execute 1 times.
            This loop will execute 2 times.
        
        You can also use a variable to set the number of iterations:
            This other loop will execute 0 times, and references a different variable each time:  first loop
            This other loop will execute 1 times, and references a different variable each time:  second loop
            This other loop will execute 2 times, and references a different variable each time:  third loop
            This other loop will execute 3 times, and references a different variable each time:  fourth loop
        ```

        ## Installation
        
        Here's what you need to do to install sassy:
        
        ### Python 3.6+
        
        Sassy is compatible with **Python 3.6 and later**.
        
        On Unix systems, install Python 3.6 (or later) via your package manager (apt, rpm, yum, brew).
        Alternatively, you can download an installation package from the [official Python downloads page](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
        
        ### Virtual Environment
        
        It is recommended to put all project dependencies into its own virtual
        environment - this way we don't pollute the global Python installation.
        For this we recommend you use **virtualenvwrapper**. Follow the instructions
        [here](http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)
        to get this installed. Once you have virtualenvwrapper install, create
        a new virtual environment with:
        
        ```bash
        mkvirtualenv sassy
        workon sassy
        ```
        
        Now let's install sassy:
        
        ```bash
        pip install sassylang
        ```
