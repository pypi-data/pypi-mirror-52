```


## Usage

### Example 1: basic usage

```

Summary:

Field                            Value
-------------------------------  -----------
Analysis start date              2019-06-07
Analysis end date                2019-09-05
Number of EC2 machines           8
Billed cost                      165.42 $
Used cost                        9.16 $
CWAU = Used / Billed * 100       6 %

For reference:
* CWAU >= 70% is well optimized
* CWAU <= 30% is underused
* isitfit version 0.1 is based on CPU utilization only (and not yet on memory utilization)
```


PS: the AWS keys should belong to a user/role with the following minimal policies:

`AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess, CloudWatchReadOnlyAccess`
