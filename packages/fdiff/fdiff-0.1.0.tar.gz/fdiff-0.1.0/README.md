## About

`fdiff` is a Python command line comparison tool that demonstrates differences in the OpenType table data between font files.  The tool provides cross-platform support on macOS, Windows, and Linux systems with a Python v3.6+ interpreter.

## What it does

- Takes two font file path arguments for comparison
- Dumps OpenType table data in the fontTools library TTX format (XML)
- Compares the OpenType table data across the two files using the unified diff format supported in the Python standard library
- Supports optional color coding of the diff lines in the terminal

## Installation

`fdiff` requires a Python 3.6+ interpreter.

Installation in a [Python3 virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) is recommended as dependencies are pinned to versions that are confirmed to work with this project.

Use any of the following installation approaches:

### pip install from PyPI

```
$ pip3 install fdiff
```

### pip install from source

```
$ git clone https://github.com/source-foundry/fdiff.git
$ cd fdiff
$ pip3 install .
```

### Developer install from source

The following approach installs the project and associated optional developer dependencies so that source changes are available without the need for re-installation.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/source-foundry/fdiff.git
$ cd fdiff
$ pip3 install --ignore-installed -r requirements.txt -e ".[dev]"
```

## Usage

```
$ fdiff [OPTIONS] [PRE-FONT FILE PATH] [POST-FONT FILE PATH]
```

By default, an uncolored unified diff is performed on the two files.  To view a colored diff in your terminal, include either the `-c` or `--color` option in your command:

##### Color diffs

```
$ fdiff --color [PRE-FONT FILE PATH] [POST-FONT FILE PATH]
```

### Other Options

Use `fdiff -h` to view all available options.

## Issues

Please report issues on the [project issue tracker](https://github.com/source-foundry/fdiff/issues).

## Contributing

Contributions are warmly welcomed.  A development dependency environment can be installed in editable mode with the developer installation documentation above. 

Please use the standard Github pull request approach to propose source changes.

### Source file linting

Python source files are linted with `flake8`.  See the Makefile `test-lint` target for details.

### Source file static type checks

Static type checks are performed on Python source files with `pytype`.  See the Makefile `test-type-check` target for details.

### Testing

The project runs continuous integration testing on [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/source-foundry/fdiff) and [Appveyor CI](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/chrissimpkins/fdiff) with the `pytest` and `tox` testing toolchain.  Test modules are located in the `tests` directory of the repository.

Local testing by Python interpreter version can be performed with the following command executed from the root of the repository:

```
$ tox -e [PYTHON INTERPRETER VERSION]
```

Please see the `tox` documentation for additional details.

### Test coverage

Unit test coverage is executed with the `coverage` tool.  See the Makefile `test-coverage` target for details.

## Acknowledgments

`fdiff` is built with the fantastic [fontTools free software library](https://github.com/fonttools/fonttools) and performs text diffs of binary font files using the TTX OpenType table data serialization format defined by that project.  The implementation of unified text file diffs is based on a (slightly) modified version of the Python `difflib` standard library source.  The modifications address performance issues with large text files like those encountered with the ttx dumps of font binary data used in this project.
