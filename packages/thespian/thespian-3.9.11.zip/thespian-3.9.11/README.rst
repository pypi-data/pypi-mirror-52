History
-------

As of 31 Mar 2017 (corresponding to version 3.7.2 of Thespian), the
Thespian primary author (Kevin Quick) is no longer working at GoDaddy.
This author is still committed to the development and maintenance of
the Thespian library, and is doing so on a forked version at
https://github.com/kquick/Thespian.  This fork will continue to use
the above mailing list, the http://thespianpy.com domain, and publish
via pypi under the "thespian" package name.

Any modifications and support of GoDaddy's original version of
Thespian (https://github.com/godaddy/Thespian) will be done solely at
GoDaddy's discretion; the original author will monitor those changes
and merge them into the author's version at
https://github.com/kquick/Thespian as appropriate.
