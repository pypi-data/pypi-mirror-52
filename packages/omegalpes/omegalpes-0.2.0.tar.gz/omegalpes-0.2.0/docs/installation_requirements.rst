******************************************************
Absolute silence, keep calm and stay focus... you can do it! :`<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4mHPeMGTJM>`_

1. Create a new folder in the suitable path, name it as you wish for instance : OMEGAlpes

    ---
    **Command lover**
    --- ::

           git clone https://gricad-gitlab.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/omegalpes/omegalpes.git

    | Test if the connection to the git works and if it works click on "Clone".
    | Once OMEGAlpes is cloned, you must be able to see the full OMEGAlpes library on Pycharm
