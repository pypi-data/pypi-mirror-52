Description: The PLIB.GUI package contains a simple GUI application framework
        with two main features:
        
        - It lets the same high-level code work with a number of
          different underlying GUI toolkits. Currently supported:
          Qt (versions 3 and 4), PySide, KDE (versions 3 and 4),
          wxWidgets, and GTK. (The original reason for writing this
          sub-package was that wxWidgets doesn't use Qt and I like
          the Qt/KDE widgets better, but Qt was not available for
          Windows and I wanted code that would run cross-platform.)
        
        - It allows you to express the layout of your GUI in terms
          of Python lists and dicts, enabling a much more declarative
          and easy to read (and maintain) coding style.
        
        Other than selecting the toolkit (which may not be necessary:
        the main module of the sub-package can 'auto-detect' which
        toolkit to use--the ``plib-setup-gui`` post-install script
        does most of the work to enable this--so you only need to
        override if you don't like the default), you should not have
        to worry about any toolkit internal details; the goal of this
        sub-package is to make them all look the same to your code.
        
        Note that the GTK toolkit support in this sub-package is
        "experimental" and may be removed if it proves to be more
        trouble than it's worth. It's currently included because
        wxWidgets' behavior when using GTK as its underlying GUI
        framework has some quirks that I haven't been able to work
        around yet. However, the GTK implementation of a number of
        widgets (particularly tables and list/tree views) is much
        less capable than the wxWidgets one, so the Python code for
        GTK ends up relying much more on ugly hacks.
        
        Note: PLIB.GUI works with Python 2.7. If you are using
        Python 3, see the PLIB3.GUI package, available at
        https://pypi.python.org/pypi/plib3.gui.
        
        The ``setup.py`` script for PLIB.GUI uses the ``setuputils``
        helper module, which helps to automate away much of the
        boilerplate in Python setup scripts. This module is available
        as a separate release at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuputils.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        To install PLIB.GUI, you can simply run::
        
            $ python setup.py install
        
        at a shell prompt from the directory into which you
        unzipped the source tarball (the same directory that this
        README file is in). This will install PLIB and then
        run each of the post-install scripts in the scripts
        directory.
        
        Example Programs
        ----------------
        
        PLIB.GUI comes with example programs that illustrate key features
        of the package. After installation, these can be found in the
        ``$PREFIX/share/plib/examples`` directory. If you have a
        POSIX system (Linux or Mac OSX), the ``plib-setup-examples``
        post-install script will install symlinks to the example
        programs in the ``$PREFIX/bin`` directory.
