**Hup** is a multi-purpose [Python](https://www.python.org/) library, which
primarily aims to support [Frootlab](https://www.frootlab.org) projects by
serving as a common base library. It was originally created in 2019 for the
[Liquid Code](https://www.frootlab.org/liquid) project to separate
[Pandora](https://www.frootlab.org/pandora) and
[Nemoa](https://www.frootlab.org/nemoa). The majority of the provided
modules, however, are kept generic to facilitate their application beyond
Frootlab projects as well.

Hup is free and open source software, based on the
[Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language and actively developed at
[Frootlab](https://www.frootlab.org).
