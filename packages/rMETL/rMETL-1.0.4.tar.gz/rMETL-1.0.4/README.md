### Introduction
Mobile element insertion (MEI) is a major category of structure variations (SVs). The rapid development of long read sequencing technologies provides the opportunity to detect MEIs sensitively. However, the signals of MEI implied by noisy long reads are highly complex due to the repetitiveness of mobile elements as well as the high sequencing error rates. Herein, we propose the Realignment-based Mobile Element insertion detection Tool for Long read (rMETL). Benchmarking results of simulated and real datasets demonstrate that rMETL has the ability to discover MEIs sensitively as well as prevent false positives. It is suited to produce high-quality MEI callsets in many genomics studies.

### Simulated datasets

The simulated datasets use for benchmarking are available at: [Google drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ujV2C8e1PNAVhSkh9vKtjWLdG_OHcH-k)

### Memory usage

The memory usage of rMETL can fit the configurations of most modern servers and workstations.
Its peak memory footprint is about 7.05 Gigabytes (default setting), on a server with Intel Xeon CPU at 2.00 GHz, 1 Terabytes RAM running Linux Ubuntu 14.04. These reads were aligned to human reference genome hs37d5.
