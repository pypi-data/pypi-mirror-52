"""Defines Ito processes.

Ito processes underlie most quantitative finance models. This module defines
a framework for describing Ito processes. An Ito process is usually defined
via an Ito SDE:

```
  dX = a(t, X_t) dt + b(t, X_t) dW_t

```

where `a(t, x)` is a function taking values in `R^n`, `b(t, X_t)` is a function
taking values in `n x n` matrices. For a complete mathematical definition,
including the regularity conditions that must be imposed on the coefficients
`a(t, X)` and `b(t, X)`, see Ref [1].

class ItoProcess(object):
  """Base class for Ito processes.

    Represents a general Ito process:

    ```None
      dX_i = a_i(t, X) dt + Sum(S_{ij}(t, X) dW_j for 1 <= j <= n), 1 <= i <= n
    ```

    `a_i(t, S)` is the instantaneous drift rate and the `S_{ij}(t)` is the
    volatility matrix. While this is how the process is usually presented
    mathematically, the initializer requires a slightly different
    specification. Instead of the instantaneous drift and volatility, it is
    computationally more efficient to use the total drift and covariance. These
    are defined as:

    ```None
      total_drift_{i}(t1, t2, X) = Integrate(a_{i}(t, X), t1 <= t <= t2)
      total_covariance_{ij}(t1, t2, X) = Integrate(inst_covariance_{ij}(t, X),
                                                t1 <= t <= t2)
      inst_covariance_{ij}(t, X) = (S.S^T)_{ij}
    ```

  ### Example. 2-dimensional Ito process of the form

  ```none
  dX_1 = mu_1 * sqrt(t) dt + s11 * dW_1 + s12 * dW_2
  dX_2 = mu_2 * sqrt(t) dt + s21 * dW_1 + s22 * dW_2

      are free to either raise an error for larger time steps or give the best
