**iFISH-Probe-Design** (`ifpd`) is a Python3 package containing tools for selection of complementary oligonucleotides to build iFISH probes. It also includes a web interface, which simplifies the procedure by removing any requirement for programming skills. Read the online [documentation](https://ggirelli.github.io/iFISH-probe-design/) for more details.

Installation
---

If you have Python3.6+ and `pip3` installed on your computer, you can simply run `sudo -H pip3 install ifpd` on a terminal. That's it! As easy as it gets.

You can also install from github (any point in history, although we suggest to stick with release tags) as follows:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ggirelli/iFISH-probe-design/
cd iFISH-probe-design
sudo -H pip3 install .
```
