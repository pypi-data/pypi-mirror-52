Description: Steam Acolyte
        =============
        
        Lightweight user account switcher/login keeper for steam.
        
        This tool provides a simple UI to switch between different steam user accounts
        without having to reenter your password/2FA. This works by copying the
        credentials depot which contains a login token for the last active user to a
        temporary location. This config is restored to the appropriate location when
        the particular user is selected from the UI.
        
        This dictates a usage as follows:
        
        - start ``acolyte``
        - choose user
        - enter password/2FA if required
        - play games
        - exit steam via "Exit" option
        - do **not** use "Change Users!" from the steam menu (this will invalidate the
          login token)
        - upon exiting steam, the current user cookie will be saved
        - the user selection dialog will popup again
        - choose user
        - ...
        
        There is no magic interaction with steam here, and we do not store any
        credentials independently from steam!
        
        Note that only linux is supported currently. Windows support is planned.
