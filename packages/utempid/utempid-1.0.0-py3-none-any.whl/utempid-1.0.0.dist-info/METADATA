# utempid

> Unique temporary id generator for python

## Usage

### Getting it
To download utempid, simply use Pypi via pip.

```shell
$ pip install utempid
```

### Using it

```python
# import the generator class
from utempid import UtempidGenerator

# create the generator
gen = utempid.UtempidGenerator()

# get temporary ids
first_id = gen.get_id() # first_id = 0
second_id = gen.get_id() # second_id = 1
third_id = gen.get_id() # third_id = 2

# return ids when no longer needed
gen.return_id(second_id)

# track amount of temporary ids in use
print(gen.active_count) # 2
```

### Example

UtempidGenerator can be used when creating temporary objects with unique ids.
When an object is destroyed, the id is returned to the generator.
This allows for an easy count of the live objects and creates ids that are limited by the maximum amount of live objects at any point.

```python
# import the generator class
from utempid import UtempidGenerator

class TemporaryObject(object):

    gen = UtempidGenerator()

    def __init__(self):
        self.id = self.gen.get_id()

    @classmethod
    def count(cls):
        return cls.gen.active_count

    def __del__(self):
        self.gen.return_id(self.id)


def main():
    a = TemporaryObject() # a.id = 0
    b = TemporaryObject() # b.id = 1
    c = TemporaryObject() # c.id = 2

    print("count: ", TemporaryObject.count()) # 3
    del a # return id 0
    print("count: ", TemporaryObject.count()) # 2

    d = TemporaryObject() # d.id = 0

    print("count: ", TemporaryObject.count()) # 3
    b = 1 # return id 1
    print("count: ", TemporaryObject.count()) # 2
```
