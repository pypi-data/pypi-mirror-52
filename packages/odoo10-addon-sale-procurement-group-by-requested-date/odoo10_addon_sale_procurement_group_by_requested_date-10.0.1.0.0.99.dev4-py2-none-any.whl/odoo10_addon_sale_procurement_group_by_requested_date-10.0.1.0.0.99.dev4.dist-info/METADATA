========================================
Sale Procurement Group by Requested date
========================================

This module creates different procurements groups for different requested
dates in a sale order line when the sale order is confirmed.
It depends on sale_sourced_by_line so this module will group procurements 
also by the warehouse in the sale order line.

Installation
============

This module depends on the modules sale_procurement_group_by_line and
sale_sourced_by_line.


Usage
=====

#. Add a requested date for a sale order line.
#. Confirm the sale order

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

This module is compatible with sale_sourced_by_line module by installing
sale_procurement_group_by_requested_date_sale_sourced_by_line. This module
is not compatible with sale_delivery_split_date. A glue module will be needed
to install sale_delivery_split_date and
sale_procurement_group_by_requested_date. This is an already known issue:
