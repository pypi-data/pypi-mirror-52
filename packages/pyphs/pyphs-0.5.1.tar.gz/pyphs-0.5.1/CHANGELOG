0.1.10
  - 
  - Change Core.build_R to Core.reduce_z.
  - Initialization of PHSSimulation is made at object instanciation by passing a dictionnary of list of sympy expressions.
  - Rename PHSCoreMethod in PHSMethod.
  - Rename PHSNumericalEval in Eval.
  - Rename PHSCoreMethod in Method.
  - Rename PHSNumericalCore in Numeric.
  - Remove 'PHS' prefix in classes names.

0.1.9.9.5
  - changes in PHSCore:
	* core.apply_connectors => core.connect
  - Improve code quality
0.1.9.9.4
  - Improve coverage
  - Implement the Thermics dictionary
  - Implement CMake build system
  - changes in PHSCore:
	* core.apply_sub => core.substitute
	* core.split_linear => core.linear_nonlinear
  - changes in PHSSimulation:
	* simu.fs => simu.config['fs']
	* simu.init(sequ=u, seqp=p, nt=nt) => simu.init(u=u, p=p, nt=nt)
	* config is no more an option to simu.init. This means the numerical object is fixed once and for all at PHSSimulation instanciation.
  - PHSNumericalMethod => PHSCoreMethod
  - latex/ => misc/latex/
  - plots/ => misc/plots/
  - simulations/ => numerics/simulations/
  - cpp/ => numerics/cpp/
