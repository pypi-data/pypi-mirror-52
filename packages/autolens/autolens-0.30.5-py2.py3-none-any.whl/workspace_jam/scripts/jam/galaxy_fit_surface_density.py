# Before reading this script, you should checkout the 'galaxy_fit_surface_density.py' script first, which shows you
# how to simulate a convergence profile and fit it with a galaxy. In this script, we'll do the same thing with
# deflection angles and using multiple galaxies. There a few benefits to fitting deflection angles instead of a surface
# density profile (or gravitational potential):

# 1) In terms of lensing, the deflection-angle map is closest thing to what we *actually* observe when we image and
#    model a strong lens. Thus fitting deflection angle maps is the best way we can compare the results of a lens model
#    to a theoretical quantity.

# 2) As we do in this example, we can simulate our deflecton angle map using multi-plane lens ray-tracing, and thus
#    investigate the impact assuming a single-lens plane has on the inferred lens model.

# Get the relative path to the config files and output folder in our workspace.
path = "{}/../../".format(os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__)))

# Use this path to explicitly set the config path and output path.

# and the second galaxy will be much lower mass as if it is a 'perturber' of the main lens galaxy.

# fit it with two singular isothermal spheres at the same lens-plane, thus we should see how the absence of multi-plane
# ray tracing impacts the mass of the subhalo.
