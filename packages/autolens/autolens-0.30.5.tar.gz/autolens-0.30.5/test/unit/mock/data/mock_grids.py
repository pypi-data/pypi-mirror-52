        A *PixGrid* is ordered such pixels begin from the top-row of the mask and go rightwards and then \
        downwards. Therefore, it is a ndarray of shape [total_pix_pixels, 2]. The first element of the ndarray \
        thus corresponds to the pixelization pixel index and second element the y or x arc -econd coordinates. For example:

        - pix_grid[3,0] = the 4th unmasked pixel's y-coordinate.
        - pix_grid[6,1] = the 7th unmasked pixel's x-coordinate.

        pix_grid : ndarray
            The grid of (y,x) arc-second coordinates of every image-plane pixelization grid used for adaptive source \

        mask_1d_index_to_nearest_pixelization_1d_index : ndarray
            A 1D array that maps every grid pixel to its nearest pixelization-grid pixel.
