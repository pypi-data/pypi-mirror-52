**README** for PLIB3.EXTENSIONS 1.1.post2

:Author:        Peter A. Donis
:Release Date:  23 Sep 2019

The PLIB3.EXTENSIONS package contains functions (and possibly,
in the future, other objects) exported from an extension
module written using the Python/C API. The general
philosophy of PLIB3 is to do everything possible in pure
Python, so the only functions that appear in this package
are those which by their very nature cannot be done in pure
Python.

Note: PLIB3.EXTENSIONS works with Python 3. If you are using
Python 2.7, see the PLIB.EXTENSIONS package, available at
https://pypi.org/project/plib.extensions.

The ``setup.py`` script for PLIB3.EXTENSIONS uses the ``setuputils``
helper module, which helps to automate away much of the
boilerplate in Python 3 setup scripts. This module is available
as a separate release at https://pypi.org/project/setuputils3.

The PLIB3.EXTENSIONS Package
----------------------------

The following functions are available in the ``plib.extensions``
namespace:

- The ``capsule_compare`` function checks whether two Capsules
  wrap the same C-level pointer.

Installation
------------

To install PLIB3.EXTENSIONS, you can simply run::

    $ python3 setup.py install

at a shell prompt from the directory into which you
unzipped the source tarball (the same directory that this
README file is in). This will install PLIB3 and then
run each of the post-install scripts in the scripts
directory.

The Zen of PLIB3
----------------

There is no single unifying purpose or theme to PLIB3, but
like Python itself, it does have a 'Zen' of sorts:

- Express everything possible in terms of built-in Python
  data structures.

- Once you've expressed it that way, what the code is
  going to do with it should be obvious.

- Avoid boilerplate code, *and* boilerplate data. Every
  piece of data your program needs should have one and
  only one source.
