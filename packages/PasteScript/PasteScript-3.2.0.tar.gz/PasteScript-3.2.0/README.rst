PasteScript is a pluggable command-line tool.

**Note**: Paste Script is being maintained on life support. That
means that critical bugs will be fixed, and support for new versions
of Python will be handled, but other than that new features are not
being considered.

It includes some built-in features;

* Create file layouts for packages.  For instance, ``paster create
  --template=basic_package MyPackage`` will create a `setuptools
  <https://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/>`_-ready
  file layout.

* Serving up web applications, with configuration based on
  `paste.deploy <https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pastedeploy>`_.

The latest version is available in a `GitHub repository
<https://github.com/cdent/pastescript/>`_.
