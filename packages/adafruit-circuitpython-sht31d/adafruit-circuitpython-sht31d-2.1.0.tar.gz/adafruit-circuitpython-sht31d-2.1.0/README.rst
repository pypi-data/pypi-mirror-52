CircuitPython module for the SHT31-D temperature and humidity sensor.

Dependencies
=============
This driver depends on:

* `Adafruit CircuitPython <https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython>`_
* `Bus Device <https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_BusDevice>`_


Please ensure all dependencies are available on the CircuitPython filesystem.
This is easily achieved by downloading
`the Adafruit library and driver bundle <https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle>`_.

Usage Example
=============
You must import the library to use it:

.. code:: python

    import adafruit_sht31d

This driver takes an instantiated and active I2C object (from the `busio` or
the `bitbangio` library) as an argument to its constructor.  The way to create
an I2C object depends on the board you are using. For boards with labeled SCL
and SDA pins, you can:

.. code:: python

    from busio import I2C
    from board import SCL, SDA

    i2c = I2C(SCL, SDA)

Once you have created the I2C interface object, you can use it to instantiate
the sensor object:

.. code:: python

    sensor = adafruit_sht31d.SHT31D(i2c)


And then you can start measuring the temperature and humidity:

.. code:: python

    print(sensor.temperature)
    print(sensor.relative_humidity)

You can instruct the sensor to periodically measure the temperature and
humidity, storing the result in its internal cache:

.. code:: python

    sensor.mode = adafruit_sht31d.MODE_PERIODIC

You can adjust the frequency at which the sensor periodically gathers data to:
0.5, 1, 2, 4 or 10 Hz. The following adjusts the frequency to 2 Hz:

.. code:: python

    sensor.frequency = adafruit_sht31d.FREQUENCY_2

The sensor is capable of storing eight results. The sensor stores these
results in an internal FILO cache. Retrieving these results is simlilar to
taking a measurement. The sensor clears its cache once the stored data is read.
The sensor always returns eight data points. The list of results is backfilled
with the maximum output values of 130.0 ÂºC and 100.01831417975366 % RH:

.. code:: python

    print(sensor.temperature)
    print(sensor.relative_humidity)

The sensor will continue to collect data at the set interval until it is
returned to single shot data acquisition mode:

.. code:: python

    sensor.mode = adafruit_sht31d.MODE_SINGLE

Contributing
============

Contributions are welcome! Please read our `Code of Conduct

before contributing to help this project stay welcoming.

Building locally
================

To build this library locally you'll need to install the
`circuitpython-build-tools <https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython-build-tools>`_ package.

.. code-block:: shell

    python3 -m venv .env
    source .env/bin/activate
    pip install circuitpython-build-tools

Once installed, make sure you are in the virtual environment:

.. code-block:: shell

    source .env/bin/activate

Then run the build:

.. code-block:: shell

    circuitpython-build-bundles --filename_prefix adafruit-circuitpython-sht31d --library_location .

Sphinx documentation
-----------------------

Sphinx is used to build the documentation based on rST files and comments in the code. First,
install dependencies (feel free to reuse the virtual environment from above):

.. code-block:: shell

    python3 -m venv .env
    source .env/bin/activate
    pip install Sphinx sphinx-rtd-theme

Now, once you have the virtual environment activated:

.. code-block:: shell

    cd docs
    sphinx-build -E -W -b html . _build/html

This will output the documentation to ``docs/_build/html``. Open the index.html in your browser to
view them. It will also (due to -W) error out on any warning like Travis will. This is a good way to
locally verify it will pass.
