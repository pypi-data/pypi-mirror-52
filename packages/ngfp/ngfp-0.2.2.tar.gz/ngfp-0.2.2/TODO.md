  Bugs and comments to Ant <ant@anthive.com> or via the
project page.


Wishlist (for someone else to do if they'd like :) )

  - it would simplify licensing if I had not used artwork 
    from gfpoken version 1-2.  I don't see myself having 
    the time in the near future to make new artwork.  I 
    really need to spend some more time studying Python 3
    and OOP concepts instead.


Notes

  I'm not planning on doing networking version at this 
time - I've never used it myself.

  - help screen (works)

  - about screen (works)

  - man page (done)


v0.1.1

  many changes and some reorganization of code.
a lot of testing and debugging of what has 
been done is still needed yet.  please don't 
report bugs - i know of a lot already...  :)

  - some global values were moved into config.py

  - configuration files and directory under
    $HOME/.config/ngfp (for a posix system, i don't	
    know much about where on windows yet)

    - configuration file name is config_ngfp.json

    - initial run of program just uses defaults from
      config.py, but eventually clicking on Save Config
      will create the directory and file and from then
      on when you start the game it will use the 
      previously saved configuration

  - restore defaults (sorta works)

  - save and load games (mostly works)

    - files in $HOME/.local/share/ngfp (for a posix 
      system, i don't	know much about where on windows yet)

    - much better dialogs and more flexibility in naming

  - new random game (mostly works)

  - resizing game (mostly works)

    - the limits i have set in config.py are for a screen
      size of 1920 x 1080 pixels, you can adjust them to
      fit your screen size:

      - min_cols = 1      # this actually works
      - min_rows = 6      # for the moment
      - max_cols = 22     # on 1920 x 1080
      - max_rows = 13     # on 1920 x 1080

        - eventually i want to get min_rows smaller
          or even have the widget counts/piles in their
          own window - this will make it easier to get
          going for children who may not want to start
          on games bigger then 4x4 or so...


v0.1.0

  - save and load games the initial simple version (works)
    - load from a gfpoken save file (works)
      - when you save it use file name "save.ngfp"
    - load as json file (works)
      - use file name "save.json"
    - save to json file (works)
      - always overwrites or writes file name "save.json"


    Notes:

      if both files ("save.ngfp" and "save.json") exist for now
    the first one "save.ngfp" is loaded and "save.json" is 
    ignored.  if you only want "save.json" used then, rename 
    "save.ngfp" or remove it.


v0.0.9

  - fix label code a bit (works)
    - can use label.text to change label

  - some animation or way of showing what happens on guess board (works)


v0.0.8

  - a bit of fun showing where the marble is bouncing
    around in the game - this doesn't stay in the final
    version, but i may leave it in as an option/toggle
    anyways because it might help in debugging...


v0.0.7


  - flipping mirrors (3-4,5-8,13-14,17-18,23-30) (works)
  - last two mirrors - they move (works)


v0.0.6

  - some game logic (works)
    - all the easy mirrors (1,2,9,10,11,12,15,16,19,20,21,22) (works)
    - putting a marble in motion (works)
    - detecting where it comes out (works)
    - history with colored markers (works)


v0.0.3-v0.0.5

  - grab widgets and put on guess board (works)
  - update counts text (works)
  - moving items (works)
  - removing items from board to go back to widget piles (works)
  - rotating guesses (works)


v0.0.0 - v0.0.2
  initial import of code so far and a few basic changes
