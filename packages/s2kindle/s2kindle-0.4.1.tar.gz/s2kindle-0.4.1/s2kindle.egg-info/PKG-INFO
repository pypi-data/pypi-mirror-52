Description: # send-to-kindle
        
        A teeny tiny app that you can use to send stuff to your kindle. 
        
        ## Usage  
        
        As simple as executing the s2k command with the url that you want to send:  
        
        ```shell script
        s2k https://medium.com/@antonio.feregrino/lorem-ipsum-cb19745555ea
        ```
        
        ## Requirements
        
        Requires the [KindleGen](https://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&docId=1000765211) app. Download it and extract it.
        
        ## Configuration
        
        This app requires a configuration file like the following:  
        
        ```
        [mail_account]
        from = send_to_kindle_01@disposable.com
        password = 07JL68r6thb3
        to = antonio.feregrino_0@kindle.com
        
        [mail_server]
        host = smtp.mail.com
        port = 587
        
        [kindlegen]
        path = /Users/user/kindlegen
        ```
        
        The `from` key must be the email that will be used to send the email to your kindle, in the same sense `password` is the password of such account. The `to` key is the email of your kindle device.  
        
        Both `host` and `port` are used to authenticate against the email server that is in charge of sending the emails.  
        
        The `kindlegen` is a path to where the *kindlegen* app has been extracted.
