Description: # pyfcomb: Easy frequency combinations
        
        Frequency combinations made easy! pyfcomb allows you to compute possible combinations of 
        frequencies from a given list of frequencies. 
        
        ## Installation
        Call
        ```
        pip install pyfcomb
        ```
        to install pyfcomb.
        
        ## Usage
        Use 
        ```python
        pyfcomb.get_combinations(f_ids,frequencies,amplitudes)
        ```
         to compute the combinations. You need to provide a list of frequency ids, frequencies and
         amplitudes all of the same length to compute combinations. You can also use the ```combo_depth```
         parameter to change the maximum amount of combinations as well as the ```accuracy``` parameter
         to change the minimum precision of combinations.
         
         The function then returns a ```pandas.DataFrame``` consisting of all frequencies and their 
         possible combinations. The best combination (in this case the one with highest precision and least
         complexity) is also used to calculate the residual from the actual frequency to the combination. Lastly,
         this DataFrame also contains a list of all other possible combinations.
         
         ### Example
         ```python
        from pyfcomb import get_combinations
        from pandas import read_csv
        
        file = read_csv("pyfcomb/tests/testfiles/freq_data.txt",delimiter="\t",header=None,names=['f_num','f','amp','snr'])
        f_num = [int(i.replace("F","")) for i in file.f_num]
        combinations = get_combinations(f_num,file.f,file.amp)
        ```
