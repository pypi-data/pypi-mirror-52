Description: # led-matrix-emulator
        Python library made for PYNQ emulations
        Emulator made by Riku Salminen. I don't own the library I am trying to simulate.
        I can't promise full accuracy in the simulations, but I hope this is helpful for
        at least testing purposes! Read documentation for more!
