        =======
        
        
        [![PyPi version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/wxnatpy.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/wxnatpy/)
        [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pauldmccarthy/wxnatpy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pauldmccarthy/wxnatpy)
        
        
        `wxnatpy` is a [wxPython](https://www.wxpython.org) widget which allows users
        to browse the contents of a [XNAT](https://xnat.org) repository. It is built
        on top of `wxPython` and
        [xnatpy](https://bitbucket.org/bigr_erasmusmc/xnatpy).
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        
        `wxnatpy` is on [PyPi](https://pypi.python.org/) - install it through `pip`:
        
        
        ```sh
        pip install wxnatpy
        ```
        
        
        `wxnatpy` is also on [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/) - install it
        through `conda`:
        
        
        ```sh
        conda install -c conda-forge wxnatpy
        ```
        
        
        **Important note for Linux users** `wnatpy` depends on `wxpython 4` which, for
        Linux platforms, is not available on PyPi.  Therefore, if you are using Linux,
        you will need to install wxPython first - head to
        https://extras.wxpython.org/wxPython4/extras/linux/ and find the directory
        that matches your OS. Then run this command (change the URL accordingly):
        
        
        ```sh
        pip install --only-binary wxpython -f https://extras.wxpython.org/wxPython4/extras/linux/gtk2/ubuntu-16.04/ wxpython
        ```
        
        
        ## Usage
        
        
        The `wxnat.XNATBrowserPanel` is a `wx.Panel`, which is intended to be embedded
        in a `wxpython` application. The `wxnat` package can also be called as a
        standalone application, e.g.:
        
        ```sh
        python -m wxnat
        ```
        
        This will open a dialog containing the browser panel, and *Download* and
        *Close* buttons.
