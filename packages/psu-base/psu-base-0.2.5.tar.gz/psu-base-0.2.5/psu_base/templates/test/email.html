    <h1>Email Test Page</h1>

    <h2>Default Recipient</h2>
    <div class="indent">
        The default recipient will receive any non-production emails intended for recipients who are not allowed
        to receive them.  The default recipient will always be the CAS-authenticated user (not the user they are
        impersonating).  When the user is not authenticated, the app should offer-up a way for them to supply the
        email address where they would like to receive the test emails (see "Dual Credit Application" as example).<br />
        <br />
        The current default recipient is: &nbsp; <b class="code">{{default_recipient}}</b>
    </div>
    <br />
    <br />

    <h2>Testing Groups</h2>
    Non-prod recipients are defined in GTVSDAX.  There used to be an interface to edit the lists in the
    "IS Change Control" (Banweb) by clicking the "Email Console" link.<br />
    <br />
