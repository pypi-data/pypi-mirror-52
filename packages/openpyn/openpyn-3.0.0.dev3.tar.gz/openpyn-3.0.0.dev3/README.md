A python3 script (systemd service as well) to manage openvpn connections. Created to easily connect to and switch between, OpenVPN servers hosted by NordVPN. Quickly Connect to the least busy servers with lowest latency from you (using current data from Nordvpn's API). Find servers in a specific country or even a city. It Tunnels DNS traffic through the VPN which normally (when using OpenVPN) goes through your ISP's DNS (unencrypted) and compromises Privacy!

## Features

-   Automatically connect to least busy, low latency servers in a given country.
-   Systemd integration, easy to check VPN status, autostart at startup.
-   Find and connect to servers in a specific city or state.
-   Uses NordVPN's DNS servers and tunnels DNS queries through the VPN Tunnel.
-   Use Iptables rules to prevent IP leakage if tunnel breaks (Experimental), ie KILL SWITCH.
-   Quickly Connect to any specific server. i.e au10 or us20.
-   Downloads and Updates (modifications) the latest config files from NordVPN.
-   Option to run the script in background (as a systemd service).
-   Options to finetune server selection based on "Server Load" or "Ping Latency".
-   Auto excludes the servers if a ping to them fails or some packets drops when pinging \\
    or if they don't support OpenVPN \\ (TCP or UDP depending upon which one you are trying to use).
-   Finds and displays nord vpn servers (with extra info) in a given country.
-   Now list and connect to servers with "Netflix" --netflix, "Peer To Peer" --p2p, "Dedicated IP" --dedicated, \\
    "Tor Over VPN" --tor, "Double VPN" --double, "Anti DDos" --anti-ddos support.
-   Desktop notification are shown when VPN connects and disconnects. (needs to run without sudo)
-   Auto retry if \[soft,auth-failure\] received, auto failover to next best server if connection dies.
-   NVRAM write support for Asuswrt-merlin
-   Pass through openvpn options, e.g. openpyn uk -o '--status /var/log/status.log --log /var/log/log.log'
-   Logs are stored in '/var/log/openpyn/' for information and troubleshooting.
-   Temporarily disable ipv6 to prevent leakage (when using -f).

## Instructions

1.  Install dependencies if they are not already present.

```bash
# common dependencies
sudo apt install openvpn python3-setuptools python3-pip
```

2.  The following python dependencies are needed and will be installed when using pip.

```bash
requests colorama coloredlogs verboselogs tqdm jsonschema
```

### Installation Methods

1.  Install openpyn with pip3 (Python=>3.5)
    **Recommended method to get the latest version and receive frequent updates.**
    Do not install with --user switch, as OpenVPN needs to run as sudo and sudo won't be able to locate openpyn.
```bash
sudo python3 -m pip install --upgrade openpyn
```

2.  Alternatively clone and install.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jotyGill/openpyn-nordvpn.git
cd openpyn-nordvpn && sudo python3 -m pip install --upgrade .
```

For the latest in development features, try the 'test' branch instead

```bash
 git clone --branch test https://github.com/jotyGill/openpyn-nordvpn.git
 cd openpyn-nordvpn && sudo python3 -m pip install --upgrade -e .
```

3.  For macOS with Python=>3.5 (credit: [1951FDG](https://github.com/1951FDG))

```bash
# common dependencies
xcode-select --install
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/sbin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
brew install python3 openvpn
sudo brew services start openvpn
```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jotyGill/openpyn-nordvpn.git
cd openpyn-nordvpn
git pull
sudo python3 -m pip install --upgrade .
```

4.  On Asuswrt-merlin, install [Entware-ng-3x](https://gist.github.com/1951FDG/3cada1211df8a59a95a8a71db6310299#file-asuswrt-merlin-md) (credit: [1951FDG](https://github.com/1951FDG))

```bash
# common dependencies
opkg install git git-http iputils-ping procps-ng-pgrep python3 python3-pip sudo
```

```bash
cd /tmp/share/
git clone https://github.com/jotyGill/openpyn-nordvpn.git
cd openpyn-nordvpn/
git pull
pip3 install --upgrade setuptools
pip3 install --upgrade .
```

> **Note**:
> Steps below not required if only using --nvram option

```bash
# change the DNS in your router, either in LAN or WAN settings
**DNS Server1** 103.86.96.100
**DNS Server2** 103.86.99.100
```

```bash
# steps need to be done once after every router reboot
modprobe tun
iptables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -o tun0 -s 192.168.1.0/24 -m conntrack --ctstate NEW -j ACCEPT
iptables -A FORWARD -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
iptables -A POSTROUTING -t nat -o tun0 -j MASQUERADE
```

## Setup

Initialise the script with "--init" (store credentials, install Systemd service, update/install vpn config files)

```bash
sudo openpyn --init
```

Note: if you get ' openpyn: command not found' when using sudo on Fedora, create a symbolic link.
`sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/openpyn /bin/openpyn`

That's it, run the script! when done with it, press "Ctr + C" to exit.

## Basic Usage

-   At minimum, you only need to specify the country-code, default port is UDP-1194, If you want to use
    TCP-443 instead, use "--tcp" switch.

```bash
openpyn us
```

-   Now, you can also specify a city or state, useful when companies (like Google) lock your
    account if you try to login from an IP that resides in a different physical location.

```bash
openpyn us -a ny
openpyn us --area "new york"
```

-   To enforce Firewall rules to prevent dns leakage, also from ip leakage if tunnel breaks. i.e KILL SWITCH
    also temporarily disables ipv6 by running "sudo sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=1"

```bash
openpyn us -f # Experimental!, Warning, clears IPtables rules!
              # (changes are non persistent, simply reboot if having networking issues)
```

-   When using "-f", To allow custom ports (from internal ip ranges, i.e 192.168 or 10.) through the firewall.

```bash
openpyn us -f --allow 22 80 443  #only accessible from local network
```

-   To allow ports from other ranges use the `--allow-config` or `--allow-config-json` options. More details can be found [here](./docs/allowed-ports-config.md)

-   To quickly connect to a specific server.

```bash
openpyn -s au10
```

-   To list all the Countries and their Country Codes where NordVPN hosts servers.

```bash
openpyn -l
```

-   To find detailed information about the available servers in a given country.

```bash
openpyn -l uk
```

-   To find servers with features like "peer-to-peer", "netflix", "tor over vpn",
    "double vpn" in all countries or a given country.

```bash
openpyn -l uk --p2p
openpyn --list uk --dedicated
openpyn -l --tor  # tor over vpn in all countries
```

-   To find the least loaded 10 NordVPN servers in US that support "peer-to-peer",
    sort them by the lowest latency from you, connect to the best one, if connection fails
    try the next one and so on.

```bash
openpyn us -t 10 --p2p
```

-   To update and run the systemd openpyn.service, use "-d" or "--daemon"

```bash
sudo openpyn us -d
```

-   To check the status of the systemd openpyn.service.

```bash
systemctl status openpyn
```

-   To kill a running openvpn connection.

```bash
sudo openpyn -k
```

-   To Flush the iptables and kill any running openvpn connections.

```bash
sudo openpyn -x   #optionally --allow 22 if using as ssh server
```

-   To Download/Update the latest vpn config files from NordVPN by:

```bash
openpyn --update
```

-   To quickly save best NordVPN server in US to NVRAM for "OpenVPN Client 5"
    (ASUSWRT-Merlin):

```bash
openpyn us --nvram 5
```
