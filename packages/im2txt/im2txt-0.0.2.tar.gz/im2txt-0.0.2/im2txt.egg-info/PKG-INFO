Description: 
        first import the package on your terminal with pip:
        ```
        pip3 install im2txt
        ```
        next you import the module:
        ```
        import im2txt
        ```
        now you just need to encode the image of your preference:
        ```
        im2txt.encode('/path/to/image/pooptest.jpg')
        ```
        you will receive a ```pooptest.txt``` file.
        This file will have the pixel value of all pixels on the image.
        
        To decode the .txt file back to an image we use:
        ```
        im2txt.decode('path/to/txtfile/pooptest.txt')
        ```
        you will receive the encoded image back again in form of .png!
