Functions for data filtering tasks.

Frequency filtering
-------------------
- 'filter_singnal' -- filter specified frequency range from signal
- 'hampel_filter' -- a type of median filter used to remove outliers
- 'hampel_correcter' -- filter based on variant of hampel_filter that 
                        has good noise suppression characteristics.

Hidden helper functions
-----------------------
- 'butter_lowpass' -- returns polynomials for lowpass IIR butterworth filter
- 'butter_highpass' -- returns polynomials for highpass IIR butterworth filter
- 'butter_bandpass' -- returns polynomials for bandpass IIR butterworth filter

def filter_signal(data, cutoff, sample_rate, order, filtertype='lowpass',
                  return_top = False):
    '''Apply the specified filed

    Function that applies the specified lowpass, highpass or bandpass filter to
    the provided dataset.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : 1-dimensional numpy array or list 
        Sequence containing the to be filtered data

    cutoff : int, float or tuple
        the cutoff frequency of the filter. Expects float for low and high types
        and for bandpass filter expects list or array of format [lower_bound, higher_bound]

    sample_rate : int or float
        the sample rate with which the passed data sequence was sampled

    order : int
        the filter order 
        default : 2

    Returns
    -------
    out : tuple
        numerator and denominator (b, a) polynomials
        of the defined Butterworth IIR filter.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> import heartpy as hp

    Assuming standard data provided
    >>> data, _ = hp.load_exampledata(0)

    We can filter the signal, for example with a lowpass cutting out all frequencies
    of 5Hz and greater (with a sloping frequency cutoff)
    >>> filtered = filter_signal(data, cutoff = 5, sample_rate = 100.0, order = 3, filtertype='lowpass')
    >>> print(np.around(filtered[0:6], 3))
    [530.175 517.893 505.768 494.002 482.789 472.315]

    Or we can cut out all frequencies below 0.75Hz with a highpass filter:
    >>> filtered = filter_signal(data, cutoff = 0.75, sample_rate = 100.0, order = 3, filtertype='highpass')
    >>> print(np.around(filtered[0:6], 3))
    [-17.975 -28.271 -38.609 -48.992 -58.422 -67.902]

    Or specify a range (here: 0.75 - 3.5Hz), outside of which all frequencies
    are cut out.
    >>> filtered = filter_signal(data, cutoff = [0.75, 3.5], sample_rate = 100.0, 
    ... order = 3, filtertype='bandpass')
    >>> print(np.around(filtered[0:6], 3))
    [-12.012 -23.159 -34.261 -45.12  -55.541 -65.336]

    Finally we can use the return_top flag to only return the filter response that
    has amplitute above zero. We're only interested in the peaks, and sometimes
    this can improve peak prediction:
    >>> filtered = filter_signal(data, cutoff = [0.75, 3.5], sample_rate = 100.0, 
    ... order = 3, filtertype='bandpass', return_top = True)
    >>> filtered[48:53]
    array([ 0.        ,  0.        ,  0.40944503, 17.08776349, 35.67256091])

def hampel_filter(data, filtsize=6):
    '''Detect outliers based on hampel filter
    
    Funcion that detects outliers based on a hampel filter.
    The filter takes datapoint and six surrounding samples.
    Detect outliers based on being more than 3std from window mean.
    See:
    https://www.mathworks.com/help/signal/ref/hampel.html
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    data : 1d list or array
        list or array containing the data to be filtered

    filtsize : int
        the filter size expressed the number of datapoints
        taken surrounding the analysed datapoint. a filtsize
        of 6 means three datapoints on each side are taken.
        total filtersize is thus filtsize + 1 (datapoint evaluated)

    windowed hampel median filter. Results in strong noise suppression 
    characteristics, but relatively expensive to compute.

    Result on output measures is present but generally not large. However,
