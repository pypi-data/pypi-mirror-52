        ### Dependencies
        
        See [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)
        
        ## Usage
        
        ### Pinboard Authentication
        
        Pintools uses [lionheart/pinboard.py](https://github.com/lionheart/pinboard.py)
        to connect with Pinboard. Authentication is completed using your Pinboard API
        token, which can be found in [settings->password](https://pinboard.in/settings/password) on Pinboard.
        
        Pintools will by default look for your Pinboard API token in `$PINBOARD_API_TOKEN`. Alternatively it
        can be specified using the `--pinboard_token` argument if you do not want to use
        the environment variable.
        
        ### Sync Github Stars
        
        Pintools can be used to copy Github stars to your Pinboard account. Starred
        gists are not currently copied.
        
        Usage:
        ```
        pintools github [-h] [--token TOKEN]
        ```
        
        #### Github Authentication
        
        Pintools uses [PyGithub](https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub) to connect to
        Github. In order to authenticate with Github, you will need to create a [Personal
        Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) in your Github account, with the
        `read:user` scope.
        
        Pintools will look for this Personal Access Token in `$PYGITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN`.
        Alternatively, this token can be specified using the `--token` arguement
        
        ### Sync Reddit Saved Links
        
        ```
        pintools reddit [-h] [--secret SECRET] [--client_id CLIENT_ID] USERNAME PASSWORD
        ```
        
        #### Reddit Authentication
        
        todo
        
        ### Organize Pinboard links by originating site
        
        todo
