        *Brea* is a planed catalog server for algorithm storage and evaluation and
        based on [GIT](https://git-scm.com/). Brea aims to serve as an algorithm
        catalog to allow the usage of abstract **currently best fitting** (CBF)
        algorithms, as required by the **Cloud-Assisted Meta Programming** (CAMP)
        paradigm.
        
        Thereby Brea is required to host and deliver algorithms as well es to
        cyclically evaluate and index them with respect to their corresponding metrics,
        using [Rian](https://www.frootlab.org/rian). An example for such a metric
        would be the average prediction accuracy within a fixed set of gold standard
        samples of the respective domain of application (e.g. latin handwriting samples,
        spoken word samples, TCGA gene expression data, etc.). Consequently Brea is
        also required to host or connect these samples by using
        [Deet](https://www.frootlab.org/deet).
        
        Due to this approach brea allows the implementation of *smart analytics*
        projects, that are automatically kept up-to-date by a minimum of maintenance
        costs. Also brea supports scientific applications, by facilitating a local
        (workgroup, lab, institution) or global publication, application and evaluation
        of algorithms, e.g. developed within a PhD-position or program.
        
        Brea is open source, based on the [Python](https://www.python.org/)
        programming language and actively developed as part of the
        [Vivid Code](https://www.frootlab.org/vivid) framework at
        [Frootlab](https://www.frootlab.org).
        
        Current Development Status
        --------------------------
        
        Brea currently is in late *Planning* stage, which immediately is followed by
        the *Pre-Alpha* stage. This means, that the projects directives, requirements
        and goals are mostly settled but so far only hardly implemented.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Comprehensive information and installation support is provided within the
        [online manual](https://brea.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). If you already have a
        Python environment configured on your computer, you can install the latest
        distributed version by using pip:
        
            $ pip install brea
        
        Documentation
        -------------
        
        The latest Brea documentation is available as an [online
        manual](https://brea.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and for download in the
        formats [PDF](https://readthedocs.org/projects/brea/downloads/pdf/latest/),
        [EPUB](https://readthedocs.org/projects/brea/downloads/epub/latest/) and
