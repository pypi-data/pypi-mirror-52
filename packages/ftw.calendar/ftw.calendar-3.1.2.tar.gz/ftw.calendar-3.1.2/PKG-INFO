Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        ``ftw.calendar`` is a calendar view based on fullcalendar (http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar).
        
        Features
        ========
        
        - Generic: ftw.calendar doesn't care about the event objects, it only needs
          a collection in which the resulting brains have a start and a end attribute.
          If the calendar view is on an other content type than a collection, it will
          show all events (types defined in portal_calendar) below this context.
        
        - Lightweight: the only requirement (apart from plone of course) is simplejson.
          Optionally, if you want to enable resizing of events and the drag and drop functionality,
          you can install jquery.ui but it is not required.
        
        - Internationalized: currently ftw.calendar is available
          in german, english and czech. Feel free to add more translations.
        
        - Integrated: ftw.calendar cares about your calendar settings.
          First day of the week is respected and displayed accordingly.
        
        - Flexible: The calendar source is implemented as an adapter. Override it to modify
          the title or add css classes.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        - Add ``ftw.calendar`` to your buildout configuration:
        
        ::
        
            [instance]
            eggs +=
                ftw.calendar
        
        - Install the generic import profile.
        
        
        Use the ``ftwcalendar_view`` as the new default view on any collection.
        The default events-collection in a new plone site should work well,
        you probably should remove the date criterions though,
        since fullcalendar needs to be able to set them according to the selected month.
        
        Calendar Source
        ===============
        
        For easy customization i recommend extending from the default calendar source
        implementation and override one of the three defined functions.
        
        This is an example from `ftw.meeting`:
        
        ::
        
            from ftw.calendar.browser.calendarupdateview import CalendarJSONSource
        
            class MeetingCalendarJSONSource(CalendarJSONSource):
        
                def generate_source_dict_from_brain(self, brain):
                    output = super(MeetingCalendarJSONSource,
                                   self).generate_source_dict_from_brain(brain)
        
                    if brain.Type == 'Meeting' and \
                       self.memberid in brain.getAttendeesOrUsers:
        
                        output['className'] += ' attendee'
        
                    return output
        
        `configure.zcml`:
        
        ::
        
            <configure zcml:condition="installed ftw.calendar">
                <adapter
                    for="* ftw.meeting.interfaces.IMeetingLayer"
                    name="ftw_calendar_source"
                    provides="ftw.calendar.browser.interfaces.IFtwCalendarJSONSourceProvider"
                    factory=".calendarsource.MeetingCalendarJSONSource"
                    />
            </configure>
        
        Calendar Event Creator
        ======================
        
        Calendar entries can be created by clicking a date/time on the calendar widget.
        Since `ftw.calendar` does not know which event type is used in a particular
        project it has to be defined by the product using `ftw.calendar`. There is no
        default implementation! It won't work unless you implement it in your product.
        
        This is done using an adapter. Here is an example from `ftw.contentpage`:
        
        ::
        
            from ftw.calendar.browser.interfaces import IFtwCalendarEventCreator
            from plone import api
            from zope.interface import implements
        
        
            class CalendarEventPageCreator(object):
                implements(IFtwCalendarEventCreator)
        
                def __init__(self, context, request):
                    self.context = context
                    self.request = request
        
                def getEventType(self):
                    return "EventPage"
        
                def createEvent(self, title, start_date):
                    return api.content.create(container=self.context,
                                              type="EventPage",
                                              title=title,
                                              startDate=start_date,
                                              endDate=start_date)
        
        `configure.zcml`
        ::
        
            <adapter
               for="* *"
               provides="ftw.calendar.browser.interfaces.IFtwCalendarEventCreator"
               factory=".adapters.CalendarEventPageCreator"
               />
        
        Troubleshooting
        ===============
        
        Often there are javascript-errors just after installing and trying the calendar view.
        Normally these are due to javascript caching and can be easily solved
        by enabling javascript debugging in the js_registry.
