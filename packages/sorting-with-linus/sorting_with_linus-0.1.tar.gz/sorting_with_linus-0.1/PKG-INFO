Description: # Sorting with Linus
        
        This package contains a few sorting methods which you might
        find useful. Check below for proper usage but here is a short
        list of all of them:
        
        1. bubble sort
        2. insertion sort
        3. quick sort
        4. selection sort
        
        Have fun with these methods.
        
        ## bubble sort
        
        ```python
        alist = [54, 26, 93, 17, 77, 31, 44, 55, 20]
        print(bubbleSort(alist))
        ```
        
        An inefficient but easy to implement sorting algorithm.
        
        ## selection sort
        
        ```python
        alist = [54, 26, 93, 17, 77, 31, 44, 55, 20]
        print(selectionSort(alist))
        ```
        
        An inefficient but easy to implement sorting algorithm.
        
        ## insertion sort
        
        ```python
        alist = [54, 26, 93, 17, 77, 31, 44, 55, 20]
        print(insertionSort(alist))
        ```
        
        An inefficient but easy to implement sorting algorithm.
        
        ## quick sort
        
        ```python
        alist = [54,26,93,17,77,31,44,55,20]
        quick_sort(alist)
        print(alist)
        ```
        
        An efficient but hard to implement sorting algorithm. Use this one!
