Description: remote_debugging_path_chromium
        ==============================
        
        `remote_debugging_path_chromium` is a wrapper script for chromium
        that allows you to connect to the chromium debugger over a UNIX
        domain socket. This is useful if you don't want to expose your
        debugger socket over localhost (which might be a security concern).
        For additional security it also provides whitelist functionality to
        only allow certain debugger methods.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Easiest way is to install from PyPI via `pip3`:
        
            $ pip3 install remote_debugging_path_chromium
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Use it the same way you would use chromium except it provides two
        extra options:
        
            - --remote-debugging-path=PATH
              This specifies the path on which you want the chromium remote
              debugger to listen.
        
            - --remote-debugging-allow=METHOD
              This turns on whitelist functionality, limiting which methods
              are allowed to be invoked through this interface. You can specify
              this multiple times.
        
        Assuming your pip install location is on your PATH, you can invoke
        it like you would invoke chromium.
              
            $ remote_debugging_path_chromium
