## Installin'

Installing is EZPZ...

    pip install pupy

### Want more???

Pupy has a few optional dependenies for reading and writing files which can be installed with the following command:
    
    pip install pupy[io]

Or you can pick and choose...

If you plan on using Jason you can install `ujson` 

    pip install ujson 
    
or `rapidjson` for a speed boost 

    pip install python-rapidjson

and if pupy can't find either it'll fall back on the python-stdlib json thing.

But wait theres more! Pupy has several optional dependencies for savings and loads which you can install with...
    
    pip install ruamel.yaml  # If ya mel in your spare time
    pip install msgpack  # If you wanna pack messages
    pip install toml  # toml (aka 'that other markup language'(?))
    pip install aiofiles  # if you wanna do async stuff
