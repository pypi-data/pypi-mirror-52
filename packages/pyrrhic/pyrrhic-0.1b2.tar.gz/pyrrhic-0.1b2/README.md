Pyrrhic
=======

Pyrrhic is a programmable Python build system that supports incremental
compilation, dynamic dependencies, and builtins for a range of tasks.

Pyrrhic is great for building static websites, or any build process where
tasks are written in Python.

brackets denote that an input was used in the command as an implicitly tracked
`@import`. The only explicit input was `main.scss`*


Features
--------

### Programmable

* Describe or generate your build rules in Python

* Implement your build steps as Python functions

### Dynamic dependencies

* Pyrrhic can automatically detect additional file dependencies without you
having to name them explicitly, e.g. by scanning files for `@import` statements

* Pyrrhic doesn't just track files: it also tracks the Python bytecode of the
command used to create an output. Change how a build command is implemented
and Pyrrhic knows to update the target.

### Correct and minimal

Save time on each build:

* Pyrrhic keeps the system up to date (correct) with the minimum of work.
  It will always apply the smallest necessary subtree of a dependency graph.

* Pyrrhic will delete stale outputs.

* If nothing changes, then Pyrrhic does nothing!

### Extensible

* Quickly create new commands out of the existing building blocks.

* Create new scanners to automatically pick up dependencies.

### Handy builtins

* `pyrrhic.commands.cat`: concatenate files with optional transformations (e.g. minify)
* `pyrrhic.commands.copy`: copy files with optional transformations
* `pyrrhic.commands.compile_file`: generic command to compile a file and track dependencies
* `pyrrhic.commands.scss`: compile SCSSâ®•CSS (`pip install libsass`)
* More planned - please open pull requests if you implement one that works well for you

### Free and Open Source Software

See [COPYING.md](COPYING.md)


Usage
-----

You can get Pyrrhic and optional dependencies with e.g. `pip install lxml libsass mistune pyrrhic parsley pydot`

The folder `examples/website` uses Pyrrhic to build a full static website from
markdown files.

Here's what it's `build.py` looks like (open the original file for expanded
comments on how to use Pyrrhic):

```python
import pyrrhic
import mycommands

rules = [
    # Compile Sass SCSS files
    (pyrrhic.commands.scss('out/style.css'), [('styles', 'main.scss')]),

    # Make XML indexes for posts and pages
    (mycommands.make_xml_index("out/posts.xml"), [('content', 'posts/**/*.md')]),
    (mycommands.make_xml_index("out/pages.xml"), [('content', 'pages/*.md'), ('content', 'pages/**/*.md')]),

    # Makes HTML pages for each post and page
    (mycommands.make_html_pages("out", template="template.html", pages_index="out/pages.xml"),
        [('content', 'posts/**/*.md')]),
    (mycommands.make_html_pages("out", template="template.html", pages_index="out/pages.xml"),
        [('content', 'pages/*.md'), ('content', 'pages/**/*.md')]),

    # Makes index.html, archive/2.html, archive/3.html, etc.
    (mycommands.make_html_indexes("out", template="template.html", pages_index="out/pages.xml"),
        [('content', 'posts/**/*.md')]),
]

dag = pyrrhic.rules.to_dag(rules)
dag.pydot("Dependency Graph").write_png("dag.png") # optionally draw the graph

# Read the result of last-run
try:
    with Path("lastrun.pyrrhic.txt").open("r") as fp:
        prev = pyrrhic.rules.deserialize(fp.read())
except FileNotFoundError:
    prev = None

# Perform the build. The actual operations are lazy and don't get applied until
# the next step.
updates = dag.apply(prev)

# Here's a simple way to ask the user a question on the command-line:
def yes_or_no(q: str):
    while True:
        reply = str(input(q+' (y/n)? ')).lower().strip()
        if reply[0] == 'y':
            return True

for op, node in updates:
    # Each update is returned as a 2-tuple. The first argument is either "d"
    # for delete, or "w" for (over)write. This way you can interactively prompt
    # the user to delete or overwrite first if you want to.

    print("%s %s" % (op, node.path))
    if op == "d":
        if yes_or_no("Delete %s" % node.path):
            node.unlink()
    elif op == "w":
        node.apply()


# Save the build result so we don't have to do as much work next run!
with Path("lastrun.pyrrhic.txt").open("w") as fp:
    fp.write(dag.serialize())
```

Status
------

This was an internal tool that we've recently open-sourced. There might be
a few changes to be made based on community feedback.

The source files and examples contain lots of explanatory comments. But
there's no formal documentation and only partial `pytest` coverage.

Hopefully, you find Pyrrhic useful. Please let us know how it works out for
you! You can open a GitHub issue or feedback at
[open-source@tawesoft.co.uk](mailto:open-source@tawesoft.co.uk)

Our next planned feature is supporting parallel builds.


Support
-------

Pyrrhic should work with Python 3.4 or above (yes, 3.4! Our policy is to support
Debian "oldoldstable" until end of life).

For community support, please open a GitHub issue with code samples if you are
having any problems.

[Tawesoft Ltd](https://www.tawesoft.co.uk/) also offer paid commercial support
where we can sign NDAs, implement custom features, etc.
