Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        The IETF_ uses a specific format for the standards and other documents it
        publishes as RFCs_, and for the draft documents which are produced when
        developing documents for publications.  There exists a number of different
        tools to facilitate the formatting of drafts and RFCs according to the
        existing rules, and this tool, **xml2rfc**, is one of them.  It takes as input
        an xml file which contains the text and meta-information about author names
        etc., and transforms it into suitably formatted output.  The input xml file
        should follow the grammars in RFC7749_ (for v2 documents) or RFC7991_ (for 
        v3 documents). Note that the grammar for v3 is still being refined, and 
        changes will eventually be captured in the `bis draft for 7991`_. 
        Changes not yet captured can be seen in the xml2rfc source `v3.rng`_.
        
        **xml2rfc** provides a variety of output formats. See the command line
        help for a full list of formats. It also provides conversion from v2 to
        v3, and can run the preptool_ on its input.

        Installation
        ============
        
        Installation of the python package is done as usual with 'pip install xml2rfc',
        using appropriate switches and/or sudo.
        
        Installation of support libraries for the PDF-formatter
        -------------------------------------------------------
        
        In order to generate PDFs, xml2rfc uses the WeasyPrint module, which
        depends on external libaries that must be installed as native packages
        on your platform, separately from the xml2rfc install.
        
        First, install the Cairo, Pango, and GDK-PixBuf library files on your
        system.  See installation instructions on the WeasyPrint Docs:
        
            https://weasyprint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html
        
        (Python 3 is not needed if your system Python is 2.7, though).
        
        (On some OS X systems with System Integrity Protection active, you may
        need to create a symlink from your home directory to the library installation
        directory (often /opt/local/lib):
        
            ln -s /opt/local/lib ~/lib
        
        in order for weasyprint to find the installed cairo and pango libraries.
        Whether this is needed or not depends on whether you used macports or homebrew
        to install cairo and pango, and the homebrew / macport version.)
        
        Next, install the pycairo and weasyprint python modules using pip.
        Depending on your system, you may need to use 'sudo' or install in
        user-specific directories, using the --user switch.  On OS X in
        particular, you may also need to install a newer version of setuptools
        using --user before weasyprint can be installed.  If you install with 
        the --user switch, you may need to also set PYTHONPATH, e.g.,
        
            PYTHONPATH=/Users/henrik/Library/Python/2.7/lib/python/site-packages
        
        for Python 2.7.
        
        The basic pip commands (modify as needed according to the text above)
        are:
        
            pip install 'pycairo>=1.18' 'weasyprint<=0.42.3'
        
        With these installed and available to xml2rfc, the --pdf switch will be
        enabled.
        
        For PDF output, you also need to install the Noto font set.  Download the full
        set from https://noto-website-2.storage.googleapis.com/pkgs/Noto-unhinted.zip,
        and install as appropriate for your platform.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        xml2rfc accepts a single XML document as input and outputs to one or more conversion formats.
        
        **Basic Usage**: ``xml2rfc SOURCE [options] FORMATS...``
        
        Run ``xml2rfc --help`` for a full listing of command-line options.

          * Fixed a case where for instance 'Section b.2' would be emitted instead 
            of the correct 'Appendix B.2'
        
          * Changed the restricted right margin for <dt> terms.
        
          * Added a check for conflicting schema information for v3 input files,

            v3 format outputs.
        
          * Adjusted the library call default value for --legacy-date-format to
            match the command line setting.
        
          * Added a script to minify javascript (through an external service), and 
            added a javascript minification step to the Makefile.
        
          * Added a html <div> for external metadata, and updated metadata.js to 
            look for online metadata also for documents served from disk.
        
          * Fixed a problem with authors without any name, with only organization 
            information present.

        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
          * Refined the preptool code that inserts reference target URLs to use an
            more appropriate guess at the extension, depending on the base URL.
        
          * Corrected a mismatch between the default value for a switch in run.py
            and base.py.
        
          * Changed the code for the --id-is-work-in-progress to avoid duplicate 
            <refcontent> insertion.

        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
          * Added a test for handling of &wj; and &nbsp; during text linebreaking.
        
          * Corrected the line break handling for &wj; and &zwsp; and changed to
            using a unicode private use code for internal "don't break" handling,
            in order to make use of &wj; possible in the XML source input.
        
          * Added country name aliases for South Korea.
        
          * In text renderer: Reverted 'Internet Draft' to 'Internet-Draft' for
            series name rendering.  Stripped empty parts from Updates: and
            Obsoletes: lists.  Added removal of U+2060 (word joiner) before
            emitting rendered text.
        
          * Adjusted the preptool inserted reference target value for 
            Internet-Drafts to include a trailing '.txt' to avoid 404s
        
          * Added U+2060 (word joiner) to the list of code points that should not
            trigger non-ASCII warnings
        
          * Added an --id-is-work-in-progress switch to let the RPC automatically
            add a <refcontent> element indicating "Work in Progress" for
            Internet-Drafts.
        
          * In HTML output, removed blank items from Updates and Obsoletes lists, 
            and reverted 'Internet Draft' in reference rendering to 'Internet-Draft'.
        
          * Added entity definitions for &wj; and &zwsp;
        
          * Fixed pyflakes issue; a variable name mismatch.
        
          * Updated the installation instructions emitted when --pdf is specified 
            without having the necessary libraries in place to also include 
            instructions for Noto font installation.
        
          * Fixed an issue with the ToC generation where sections without numbers 
            might still be rendered with the whitespace intended to go between number 
            and section title.
        
          * Fixed an issue with the HTML ToC where sections without numbers might 
            still be rendered with the whitespace intended to go between number and 
            section title.
        
          * Removed pilcrows from print layout to avoid spurious extra lines for 
            paragraphs where the pilcrow would not fit at the end of the last line.
        
          * Fixed an insufficient test for URL vs. local file when handling the 
            --metadata-js-url switch.
        
          * Tweaked the CSS for print to avoid reference entries beginning on a new 
            line, below the reference tag.
