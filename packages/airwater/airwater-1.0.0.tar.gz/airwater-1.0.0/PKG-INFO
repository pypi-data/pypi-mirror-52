        **Airwater** is a Python library that offers a sensible and human-friendly approach to Simply write spider, it helps you work with write spider with fewer imports and a lot less code.
        
        
        
        Why use Arrow over built-in modules?
        ------------------------------------
        
        Python's standard library and some other low-level modules have near-complete date, time and timezone functionality, but don't work very well from a usability perspective:
        
        - Too many modules: datetime, time, calendar, dateutil, pytz and more
        - Too many types: date, time, datetime, tzinfo, timedelta, relativedelta, etc.
        - Timezones and timestamp conversions are verbose and unpleasant
        - Timezone naivety is the norm
        - Gaps in functionality: ISO-8601 parsing, timespans, humanization
