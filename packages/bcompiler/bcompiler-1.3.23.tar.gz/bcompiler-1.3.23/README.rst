Introduction
-------------

``bcompiler`` is a tool to manage data involved in the BICC reporting process at the UK Department for Transport.

``bcompiler`` processes data held in Excel files, either compiling similar data
from many Excel files into a single master spreadsheet, or populating many
Excel files using the data from a master spreadsheet.

"Auxiliary" files are required to map data in each direction, and to templates.
These files are contained in a DfT reporitory on GitHub. ``bcompiler`` can be
used to obtain/update these files.

Documentation
-------------

Full documentation for the project can be found at http://bcompiler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html.
