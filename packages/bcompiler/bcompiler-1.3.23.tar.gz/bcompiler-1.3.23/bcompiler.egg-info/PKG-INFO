        Introduction
        -------------
        
        ``bcompiler`` is a tool to manage data involved in the BICC reporting process at the UK Department for Transport.
        
        ``bcompiler`` processes data held in Excel files, either compiling similar data
        from many Excel files into a single master spreadsheet, or populating many
        Excel files using the data from a master spreadsheet.
        
        "Auxiliary" files are required to map data in each direction, and to templates.
        These files are contained in a DfT reporitory on GitHub. ``bcompiler`` can be
        used to obtain/update these files.
