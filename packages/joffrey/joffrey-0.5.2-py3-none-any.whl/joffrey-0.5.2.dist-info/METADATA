# Yet Another Command-Line-Argument Parser

I'm tired of working around argparse. This suits my needs a tad better; vaguely inspired by
[discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py)'s brilliant
[ext.commands](http://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/rewrite/ext/commands/index.html) framework.



## Why?
I needed a way to define sort-of-complex interdependencies between command-line options. None of the packages
I found\* were able to handle this out of the box to an acceptable degree, so I decided to try my own hand;
I feel like the lib should be able to handle this stuff itself, without your needing to delegate roles like *"check
that these two flags aren't used at the same time as this arg"* or *"make sure all these things appear
together, or alternatively that this second thing does"* to external functions or post-parsing if-statements.

*Note: about a month after starting I discovered "[RedCLAP](https://github.com/marekjm/clap)", which did beat Joffrey
to the idea of AND/OR/XOR clumps (by the names of "requires", "wants", and "conflicts"), albeit with a very different
design philosophy overall; credit's due for (AFAIK) originating that concept, however! I also at about the same time
found [argh](https://argh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), which despite not solving the clumping issue appears
to (by pure coincidence) share a number of features with Joffrey -- but it's currently looking for maintainers and does
depend on argparse underneath (which I'm trying my best to get away from), so I'd say we're good.

Joffrey, by the way, is still an experiment. If it really doesn't solve the same problem for you that it does for me,
I think you'd be better off trying something else -- [here's a list](https://gist.github.com/supposedly/01224262b816df21b601ab0784d5f999)
of alternatives to check out!


## The name
**Pars**ley, for **pars**ing, is called جعفری /d͡ʒæʔfæˈɾi/ in Farsi. That glottal stop is elided into a vowel in Iran,
giving /d͡ʒæːfæˈɾi/, and if you squint hard enough that resembles a heavily accented pronunciation of "Joffrey".
