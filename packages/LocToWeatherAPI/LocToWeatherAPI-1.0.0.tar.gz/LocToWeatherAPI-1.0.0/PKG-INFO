Description: # Location_To_Climate_API
        
        This API is used for converting location name as a string to the respective locality's weather data. Import "main.driver(place,date="<date in string format>",type_of_forecast="<Any one from 1 to 4 in string format>") from package "LocationToCliamteAPI". You can pass ANY ONE OF the keyword arguments - Date in "YYYY-MM-DD" format/ forecast type required ('1' for today {Default Selection}, '2' for monthly,'3' for 5-day and '4' for 10-day). We are relying on APIs used by weather.com internally for extracting the respective data.
        
        For ex:
        
        If you just want today's weather metrics with place name: LocationToCliamteAPI.main.driver("Place-Name")
        
        If you just want the current month's with place name: LocationToCliamteAPI.main.driver("Place-Name",type_of_forecast="2"<option for monthly data>)
        
        If you just want some date's weather prediction with place name: LocationToCliamteAPI.main.driver("Place-Name",date="date string in yyyy-mm-dd format")
        
        package is installable as "pip install LocationToCliamteAPI"
        
        If no/wrong keyword arguments given, it may result in wrong output
        
        Included BROWSABLE API can be started with LocationToCliamteAPI.api_server.start(), where the home page, i.e, "/" contains the instructions for accessing the different endpoints.
        
        For ex:
        
        "/<Name of Place>/" or "/<Name of Place>/1/" - Today's weather for Place
        "/<Name of Place>/2/" - Monthly forecast for place
        "/<Name of Place>/3/" - 5 days forecast for place.
        "/<Name of Place>/4/" - 10 days forecast for place
        "/<Name of Place>/<Date>/" - <Date>'s forecast for place
