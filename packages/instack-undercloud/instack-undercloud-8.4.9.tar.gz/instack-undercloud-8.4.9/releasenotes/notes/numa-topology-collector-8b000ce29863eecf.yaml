    Add 'numa-topology' collector to 'ipa-inspection-collectors' if
    'inspection_extras' is true. The 'numa-topology' collector will fetch the
    details about memory, cpu, nics associated with each NUMA node during
    introspection. These details will be necessary in deriving the deployment
    parameters for NFV usecases.
