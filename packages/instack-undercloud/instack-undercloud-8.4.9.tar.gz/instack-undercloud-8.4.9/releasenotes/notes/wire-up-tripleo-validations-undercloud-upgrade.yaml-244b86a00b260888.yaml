upgrade:
  - Wires up execution of the "post-upgrade" group of tripleo-validations to
    sanity check the undercloud. The validations are executed at the
    very end of the process, after the undercloud has been fully upgraded
    and all services started in the upgraded versions. If there is an error it
    is logged but not raised so these validations will not fail the upgrade.
    The operator can set the existing 'enable_validations' to false to skip
    these validations.
