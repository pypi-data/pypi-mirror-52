    Previously, when an IP value was provided for the undercloud_public_host
    or undercloud_admin_host config value, it was validated to ensure it fell
    within the network_cidr.  This was to avoid problems when the CIDR was
    changed but the IPs were not.  However, this validation was broken for a
    time in the case where generate_service_certificate was used.  During this
    time, the UI began to depend on the broken validation as it needs to
    listen on a routable network, which the provisioning network often is not.
    When the validation was fixed, the user was no longer able to configure
    the host values to listen on a different routable network.

    To enable this UI functionality again, the host validation has been
    disabled when enable_ui is true.  This means the user is responsible for
    selecting functional host values, but the UI can once again be configured
    to listen on a separate network.
