upgrade:

    Undercloud upgrade will handle the change of ownership for ironic-dbsync.log
    to become ironic:ironic instead of root:root.
    Indeed, https://review.openstack.org/#/c/457478/ broke TripleO upgrades but
    it's to fix a valid issue in the puppet-ironic module. We still want to handle
    upgrades for existing deployments, that's why we manage the ownership change
    in instack-undercloud.
