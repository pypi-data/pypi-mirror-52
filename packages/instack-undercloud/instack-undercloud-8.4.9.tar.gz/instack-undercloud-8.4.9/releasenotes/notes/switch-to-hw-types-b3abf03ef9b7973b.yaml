    Classic drivers are going to be deprecated soon, it is recommended to
    switch all overcloud nodes to matching hardware types. See the `hardware
    types migration documentation
    <https://docs.openstack.org/ironic/latest/admin/upgrade-to-hardware-types.html>`_
    for the detailed procedure.

    ``discovery_default_driver`` option was changed from ``pxe_ipmitool``
    to ``ipmi``.
