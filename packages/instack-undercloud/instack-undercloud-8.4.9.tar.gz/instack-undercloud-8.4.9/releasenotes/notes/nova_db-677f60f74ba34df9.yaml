    Increase sync timeout for nova db syncs.
    We have seen on lower quality hardware that the nova db syncs can take
    an excessive amount of time. In order to still support deploying on this
    hardware, we now increase the timeout from the default 300 seconds to 900
    seconds to allow for this less performant gear.
    This value should never be bumped to more than 900. If we ever happen to
    hit such time outs again, we'll have to investigate and fix the root cause.
