upgrade:
  - |
    During an upgrade to this release, a migration of all nodes from classic
    drivers to hardware types will be attempted. For some nodes it may result
    in non-supported optional interfaces (like "agent" RAID or shellinabox
    console) to be reset to their no-op implementations (like "no-raid" RAID or
    "no-console" console). Nodes that cannot be upgraded will be skipped.
    Manual upgrade will be required, since the classic drivers may be removed
    in the Rocky release.
