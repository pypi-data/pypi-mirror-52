    The environment configuration for deployments is now stored in a
    file called ``plan-environment.yaml`` that is stored in Swift
    together with the templates. Mistral is no longer used to store
    this data. ``openstack undercloud upgrade`` handles the migration
    of existing plans automatically, including the deletion of the
    Mistral environment.
