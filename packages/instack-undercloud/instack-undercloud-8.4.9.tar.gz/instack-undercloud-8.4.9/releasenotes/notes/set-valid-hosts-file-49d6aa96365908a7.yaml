fixes:
  - When the hostname was written to /etc/hosts, it resulted in an invalid
    /etc/hosts file due to 127.0.0.1 being specified twice on different lines.
    That issue is now corrected such that the hostnames will be added to the
    existing line for 127.0.0.1, which results in valid syntax for /etc/hosts.
