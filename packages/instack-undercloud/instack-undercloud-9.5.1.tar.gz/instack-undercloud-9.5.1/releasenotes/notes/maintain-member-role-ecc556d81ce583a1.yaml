    The _member_ role (if it exists) on the admin user will now be retained
    automatically during undercloud upgrades.  This functionality was
    originally added to work around an issue with upgrading very old versions
    of TripleO, but was broken by changes to the upgrade process.  It will
    no longer be necessary to manually add the _member_ role to the admin user
    after upgrading an affected deployment.
