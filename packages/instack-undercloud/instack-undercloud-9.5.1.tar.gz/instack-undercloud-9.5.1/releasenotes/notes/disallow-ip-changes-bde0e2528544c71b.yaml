    Network configuration changes are no longer allowed during undercloud
    upgrades.  Changing the local_ip of a deployed undercloud causes problems
    with some of the services, so a pre-deployment check was added to prevent
    such changes.

    Because the default CIDR was changed in this release, the check also
    prevents accidental reconfiguration of the ctlplane network if the old
    default is still in use, but not explicitly configured.
