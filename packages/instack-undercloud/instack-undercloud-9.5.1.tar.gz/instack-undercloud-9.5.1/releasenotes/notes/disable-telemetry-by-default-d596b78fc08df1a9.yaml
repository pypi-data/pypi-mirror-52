upgrade:
  - If you had telemetry enabled in Ocata and you upgrade to pike with
    defaults, the telemetry services will be disabled upon upgrade. If
    you choose to keep it enabled, set the enable_telemetry option to
    true before upgrade and services will continue to be enabled after upgrade.
fixes:
  - Finally disabling telemetry services on undercloud by default. Telemetry
    use case has been quite limited on undercloud and it makes sense to
    disable by default and let user enabl based on need.
