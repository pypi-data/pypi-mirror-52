upgrade:
  - During upgrade make sure to remove any left over tuskar packages. This
    has been known to cause problems during the upgrade. See bug 1691744
    for more information
fixes:
  - Closes bug https://bugs.launchpad.net/tripleo/+bug/1691744 which is
    caused by left-over tuskar packages. This would only affect environments
    deployed with TripleoO since Kilo and for which tuskar has not explicitly
    been removed.
