upgrade:
  - |
    During the upgrade to Ocata, ironic-inspector is switched from a local
    SQLite database to the same MySQL/MariaDB all other services are using.
    Please make sure that no introspections are in progress during upgrade.
    Please re-create introspection rules after the upgrade.
    This change does not affect the ability to retrieve introspection data
    from introspection runs before the upgrade.
