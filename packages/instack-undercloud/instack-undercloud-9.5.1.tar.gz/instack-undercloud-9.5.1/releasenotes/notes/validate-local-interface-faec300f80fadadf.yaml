fixes:
  - |
    Validate the local_interface for the undercloud install to fail fast if
    the interface does not actually exist on the system. If net_config_override
    is configured, the local_interface will not be validated.
  - |
    Log a warning if undercloud.conf is missing to indicate that the defaults
    will be used.
