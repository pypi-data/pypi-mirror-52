    6.0.0 is the final release for Ocata.
    It's the first release where release notes are added.
features:
  - Support for gnocchi service on undercloud to provide metrics support in
    Telemetry. This will only be enabled when enable_telemetry is true.
  - Support for panko service on undercloud to provide events support in
    Telemetry. This will only be enabled when enable_telemetry is true.
  - Remove Glance Registry from undercloud. It also means Glance API v1 won't
    be available anymore.
  - Validate vips when generating certificate.
  - Improve upgrade process to include upgrade flag. This flag will be used
    by the Puppet manifest to knows when an upgrade happens.
  - Deploy Nova Placement API service.
  - Novajoin service support.
  - Run `yum update -y` before Puppet run.
  - Optional Cinder support for undercloud.
  - When Cinder is enabled, deploy both v2 and v3 APIs.
  - Aodh is now configured by default to use its own mysql backend.
deprecations:
  - Ceilometer API is officially deprecated. The service is still enabled
    when enable_telemetry is true. This can be disabled using the
    enable_legacy_ceilometer_api option in undercloud.conf. Users should
    start migrating to aodh, gnocchi and panko in future.
