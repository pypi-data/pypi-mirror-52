    Introspection now detects and properly set boot mode (BIOS or UEFI) for
    ironic nodes.

  - |
    The boot mode (BIOS or UEFI) is now detected on introspection and stored
    on nodes as part of ``boot_mode`` capability. This has two consequences:

    * If you change the actual boot mode via hardware management interface,
      you have to either re-run introspection or update it manually.

    * If you set **expected** boot mode on Ironic nodes manually (for drivers
      that support it, e.g. ``pxe_ilo``), you have to double-check it after
      every introspection run and fix if necessary.
