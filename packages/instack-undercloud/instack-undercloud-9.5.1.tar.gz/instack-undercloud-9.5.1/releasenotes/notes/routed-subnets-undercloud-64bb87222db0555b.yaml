    With support for routed networks, several options are deprecated and the
    way undercloud networking is defined in the configuration file has several
    changes. Please refer to the **Deprecation Notes** and **Upgrade notes**
    section for details.
features:
  - |
    Routed networks support adds the ability to configure Ironic Inspector
    and Neutron provisioning network in the undercloud to enable provisioning
    of nodes via DHCP-relay to the undercloud from remote routed network
    segments. Routed networks is by default disabled, to enable set option
    ``enable_routed_networks`` to ``True`` in ``undercloud.conf``.

    .. Note:: Changing the ``enable_routed_networks`` option after the initial
              undercloud installation is not possible.
upgrade:
  - |
    With support for routed network segments, several options are deprecated
    and the way undercloud networking is defined in the configuration file has
    several changes.

    **New option:** ``subnets`` A list of subnets. One entry for each routed
    network segment used for provisioning and introspection. For each network
    segment a section/group needs to be added to the configuration file
    specifying the following subnet options:

    ======================  ================================================
    option                  Description
    ======================  ================================================
    ``cidr``                Network CIDR for the subnet.
    ``dhcp_start``          Start of DHCP allocation range for PXE and DHCP.
    ``dhcp_end``            End of DHCP allocation range for PXE and DHCP.
    ``inspection_iprange``  Temporary IP range that will be given to nodes
                            during the inspection process.
    ``gateway``             Network(subnet) gateway/router.
    ``masquerade``          (Boolean) If ``True`` the undercloud will
                            masquerade this network for external access.
    ======================  ================================================

    **New option:** ``local_subnet`` The name of the local subnet, where the
    PXE boot and DHCP interfaces for overcloud instances is located. The IP
    address of the local_ip/local_interface should reside in this subnet.

    .. Note:: Upgrade with migration to routed networks support is not
              possible.

              Routed networks use the neutron segments service_plugin, this
              plugin adds functionality that allows subnet to be associated
              with a network segment. It is currently not possible to add
              segment association to an existing subnet, because of this we
              cannot add segment association to the existing ctlplane subnet
              on the upgraded undercloud. The existing ctlplane network and
              subnet will still be in place after an upgrade and the upgraded
              undercloud can continue to manage the existing overcloud.

    The following example shows what changes to make to the configuration to
    move to the new model.

    Replace usage of deprecated options::

      [DEFAULT]
      network_gateway = 192.168.24.1
      network_cidr = 192.168.24.0/24
      dhcp_start = 192.168.24.5
      dhcp_end = 192.168.24.24
      inspection_iprange = 192.168.24.100,192.168.24.120
      masquerade_network = 192.168.24.0/24

    replace with::

      [DEFAULT]
      subnets = subnet0
      local_subnet = subnet0

      [subnet0]
      cidr = 192.168.24.0/24
      dhcp_start = 192.168.24.5
      dhcp_end = 192.168.24.24
      inspection_iprange = 192.168.24.100,192.168.24.120
      gateway = 192.168.24.1
      masquerade = True
deprecations:
  - With support for routed networks/subnets the ``network_gateway`` option in
    the ``[DEFAULT]`` section is deprecated. Moved to per-subnet options
    group.
  - With support for routed networks/subnets the ``network_cidr`` option in
    the ``[DEFAULT]`` section is deprecated. Moved to per-subnet options
    group.
  - With support for routed networks/subnets the ``dhcp_start`` and
    ``dhcp_end`` options in the ``[DEFAULT]`` section are deprecated. Moved to
    per-subnet options group.
  - With support for routed networks/subnets the ``inspection_iprange`` option
    in the ``[DEFAULT]`` section is deprecated. Moved to per-subnet options
    group.
  - With support for routed networks/subnets the ``masquerade_network``
    option in the ``[DEFAULT]`` section is deprecated. Use the boolean option
    in each subnet group.
