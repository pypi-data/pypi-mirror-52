    Changed the configuration of endpoints that UI uses in order to connect to
    the Undercloud in a non-SSL deployment.  The port number that the UI now
    uses to communicate with the Undercloud for non-SSL connections is 3000,
    which supports endpoint proxy configuration.  Previously, this port number
    was the default port number for the service endpoint that UI connected to.
