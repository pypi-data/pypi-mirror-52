Users/Calendars
---------------
* Each user expresses x number of project "buckets" they can handle in a given week.

Projects
--------
* Each project breaks down in to stages:
  BA, DEV, QA, UAT, INSTALL, SUPPORT (A project may not necessarily go through all stages. Current example assigns all stages.)

Stages
------
* Each stage is assigned a "user" who is repsonsible for that bucket in the schedule.
* Each stage is assigned x number of "buckets" per x number of weeks.
    4 = 4 consecutive buckets
    1/1/1/1 = 1 bucket over 4 weeks
* A stage can have a specific minimum start week
    2019-12-01/2/2 = 2 buckets per week for 2 weeks starting no earlier than Dec 1, 2019.

Assignments
-----------
* Each project is distributed in the order of priority.
* Each stage is ordered in sequence:
  BA -> DEV -> QA -> UAT -> INSTALL -> SUPPORT.
