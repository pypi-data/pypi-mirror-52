`ignis` is a high-level library that helps you write compact but full-featured training loops with metrics, early stops,
and model checkpoints for deep learning library [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).

With `ignis` you can solve problems thet require Supervised Learning and Deep Reinforcement Learning.

You can extend `ignis` according to your own needs. You can implement custom functionalities by extending simple
abstract classes.

## Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms

1.  Deep Q Network (DQN)
2.  Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG)

## Installation

1.  Install PyTorch. You can find it here: [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
2.  `pip install ignis`

## Examples

You can find examples in `examples/` directory

You can also run examples: `python examples/iris.py`

You might want to `export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/this/directory`

## Contribute

1.  Implement new functionalities
2.  Improve code design
3.  Improve comments and readme
4.  Tests
