# What is SPIKE ? #

**SPIKE** a collaborative development for a FT-spectroscopy processing program.

*This is the version 0.99.12 - September 2019*

**SPIKE** is a program that allows the processing, the display and the analysis of data-sets obtained from various Fourier-Transform spectroscopies. The name stands for **S**pectrometry **P**rocessing **I**nnovative **KE**rnel.

It allows the processing of **1D** and **2D** FT spectroscopies, implementing Real, Complex and HyperComplex n-dimensionnal Fourier Transform, as well as many other functionalities.

It is written in python (tested in python 2.7 and 3.6) and can be used as a set of tools, using for instance `jupyter notebook` as an interactive front-end.

To our knowledge, it is the first program freely available allowing the processing, display and analysis of 2D-FT-ICR (Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance), as well as **Orbitrap** time domain data. processing.

It is still in very active development.
Many features are missing, and many other while present, are not fully fixed.
However, considering the amount of efforts already present in this code, we decided to make it available.
We believe that even in this partial development stage, this program might prove useful for certain usages.

# Usage

## As a processing library
SPIKE is primary meant for being used as a library, code can as simple as :

```python
from spike.File import Solarix 

dd = Solarix.Import_1D('FTICR-Files/ESI_pos_Ubiquitin_000006.d')  # Import create a basic SPIKE object

dd.hamming().zf(2).rfft().modulus()    # we have a simple piped processing scheme
  # here doing apodisation - zerofilling (doubling the size) - FT and modulus.
  # calibration is imported from Bruker - advanced calibration is available

dd.unit = "m/z"
dd.display(zoom=(500,2000))     # display the spectrum for m/z ranging from 500 to 2000

dd.pp(threshold=1E7)         # peak-pick the spectrum in this range
dd.centroid()                # compute centroids

dd.display(zoom=(856.5, 858.5))    # and zoom on the isotopic peak
dd.display_peaks(zoom=(856.5, 858.5), peak_label=True)
```

## interactive mode
SPIKE allows to process datasets interactively from an jupyter (IPython) prompt, and is perfectly working in `jupyter notebook` or even `jupyter lab`

* Look at the examples files ( `eg_*.py` and `*.ipynb` ) for examples and some documentation.
  ( * not fully up to data * )
* display is performed using the `Matplotlib` library.
* large 2D-FT-ICR are handled in batch using the `processing.py` batch program, controlled by parameter file called `*.mscf`
* The batch mode supports multiprocessing, both with MPI and natively on multi-core machines (still in-progress)
* large 2D-FT-ICR are stored in a hierarchical format, easyly displayed with an interactive program.
* data-sets are handled in the HDF5 standard file-format, which allows virtually unlimited file size ( _tested up to 500 Gb_ ).

## running stand-alone programs

processing.py and visu2D.py are two stand alone programs, written on the top of SPIKE.
 - processing.py allowing the efficient processing
   of FT-ICR 2D datasets, with no limit on the size of the final file
   Produces multi-resolution files
   
syntax :
```
python -m spike.processing param_file.mscf
```


# How do I get SPIKE ? ##
SPIKE is written in pure Python, and relies on several external libraries.
It is compatible and fully tested with both python 2.7 and python 3.6

However it relies on mathematical libraries which should be installed independently.

- matplotlib
- numpy
- scipy
- tables
- pandas

some plugins or extension require additional libraries ( `MPI`, `bokeh`, `mayavi`, ...)

To get it, you can simply 
- rely on a scientific distribution such as Anaconda or Enthough
- install the above python distributions yourself (tricky)

Then you can install it using pip:
```bash
pip install spike-py
```

Or, if you want to play with the code, 

- download the latest stable version here : https://bitbucket.org/delsuc/spike/downloads
- *or* `hg clone` the devel branch and keep it up-to-date


```bash
python setup.py install
```
or, if you do not want to instal it permanently
```bash
python setup.py develop
```
using pip
```bash
pip install spike_py
```

## dependencies
It requires the following non-standard Python libraries :

* [Numpy](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/)
* [Scipy](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/)
* [Matplotlib](http://Matplotlib.org/contents.html)
* HDF5 / [Pytables](http://www.pytables.org/moin)

Optionnaly

* MPI / [mpi4py](http://www.mpi4py.scipy.org/) used for parallel processing of large FTICR 2D files
* [cupy](https://github.com/cupy/cupy) for computating in the GPU using Cuda, which allows to speed up considerably certain processing steps.

It has been successfully tested in the [**Enthought**](https://enthought.com/) and [**Anaconda**](http://continuum.io/) distributions.



## History ##

**SPIKE** is originated from the _Gifa_ program, developed by M-A Delsuc and others in `FORTRAN 77` since the late eighties.
_Gifa_ has known several mutations, and finally ended as a partial rewrite called **NPK**.
The [NPK](http://abcis.cbs.cnrs.fr/NPK/) program is based on some of the original `FORTRAN` code, wrapped in Java and Python, which allows to control all the program possibilities from the Python level.
NPK is purely a computing kernel, with no graphical possibilities, and has been used as a kernel embedded in the commercial program NMRNoteBook, commercialized by NMRTEC.

However, NPK was showing many weaknesses, mostly due to the 32bits organization, and a poor file format. So, when a strong scientific environment became available in Python, a rewrite in pure Python was undertaken. To this initial project, called NPK-V2, many new functionalities were added, and mostly the capability to work in other spectroscopies than NMR.

At some point in 2014, we chose to fork NPK-V2 to SPIKE, and make it public.

# Developing for SPIKE
**SPIKE** is an open-source program, this means that external contributions are welcomed.
If you believe your improvement is useful for other people, please submit a `pull request`.
**Note** that pull request should be associated to the `devel` branch.
This branch is devoted to new features not fully tested yet and still susceptible of changes,
while the `default` branch is meant for stable code.

## plugins
If you consider adding some new feature, it is probably a good idea to implement it as a plugin.
The code contains already quite a few plugins, some are quite sophisticated - see `Peaks.py` for instance which implements a 1D and 2D peak picker, as well as a centroid evaluation and a full listing capability.

You can check also `fastclean.py` for a very simple plugin, or `wavelet.py` for a plugin relying on an external library which has to be installed.

## Some Good Practice

- Spike contains many tools, most of the basic function for data interaction are found in the `NPKData.py` master file; utilities are also scattered in the `util` module.
Use then, life will be easier for the users.
- Please write tests, even for the plugins ! We use standard python `unittest`, so nothing fancy. All the tests are run automatically every night (code is `Tests.py`), so it will detect rapidly all potential problem.
- push your pull requests to the `devel` branch - `default` is for the stable releases.

## Organisation of the Code ##

The main program is `NPKData.py`, which defines NPKData object on which everything is built.

Spectroscopies are defined in the `FTICR.py` and `Orbitrap.py` code, which sub class NPKData.
It is prototyped as an NMR data-set. This set-up is temporary.

Many programs contain routines tests (in an object unittest) that also serve as an example of use.
The code goes through extensive tests daily, using the `unittest` Python library. However, many tests rely on a set of tests data-sets which is more than 1Go large, and not distributed here.
