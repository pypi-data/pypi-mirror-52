        setuptools_freeze
        =================
        Integrate "pyinstaller" to "setuptools". This will make it easy to freeze your
        package. More precisely, it will create a executable file form the console
        scripts entry points in your package.
        
        
        How to use
        ----------
        Add "setuptools_freeze" to your setup requires::
        
          setup(
              ...
              setup_requires=[
                  'setuptools_freeze',
                  ...
              ],
              entry_points={
                  'console_scripts': ['<script name>=mypackage.gui:main']
              },
              ...
          )
        
        Now you can freeze your project::
        
          python setup.py pyinstaller
        
        This will create the folder "dist/<script name>", which include the executable
        file.
        
        If you also use "Inno Setup" to create a executable setup file, you can use the
        "inno" command. Before that you have to do two thinks.
        1. Install "Inno Setup" and add the compiler to your $PATH
        2. Add a guid to the setup file
        Now you can run::
        
          python setup.py inno
        
        Developer nodes
        ---------------
        This is still under develop. This is even more a proof of concept, than a
        beautiful package. But it work for my case and hopefully I will make it
        beautiful in future.
        
        Developer tools::
        
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip wheel setuptools flake8 tox
        
        Install::
        
          python setup.py install
        
        Test::
        
          python setup.py flake8
          python setup.py test
        
        Build::
        
          python setup.py build
        
        ToDo
        ----
        1. create build folder if not exist
