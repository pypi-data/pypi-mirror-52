Description: # smps_py_parser
        Utility for parsing smps files.
        ## Installation
        Clone this repository and execute
        ```bash
        pip install -e .
        ```
        inside the cloned folder. This should install the module *smpspy* to your pip list. You can then import this module using
        ```python
        from smpspy import smps_loader as smps
        ```
        at the beginning of your python code.
        You maybe want the folder you cloned to be in your PYTHONPATH, so check that if it is not working.
        ## Functions
        This module exports the functions `load_lp` for loading mps files and `load_smps` for loading smps directories.
        ## TODO
        - [ ] Scenario support in sto file parsing.
        - [x] Block support in 2-stage problem casting.
