  Use either ``Products.EasyNewsletter[taskqueue]`` or ``Products.EasyNewsletter[taskqueue_redis]`` extra.
  Configure a named task queue ``Products.EasyNewsletter.queue``.
  Read carefully the documentation of ``collective.taskqueue``.
* ``collective.zamqp`` for asynchronous sendout.
  Configure a queue named ``Products.EasyNewsletter.queue`` (DEPRECATED).

Known Issues
