Database-agnostic JSON schema discovery

Quickly get insight into the general structure of a large set of JSON files by creating a structure summary showing the type and frequency of objects key


Quickstart
----------

Start with ``Empty`` or by passing a python object to ``make_schema()``

Merge a schema onto another using ``+=`` (also accepts python objects on the right hand side)

Visualize the resulting schema with ``dumps()`` or by printing the object

Get a detailed tabulated view of the overall structure with ``statistics()``
