Description: A package for converting between attitude representations (DCM, Euler angles, Quaternions, and Euler vectors).
        Plus conversion between 2 Euler angle set types (xyx, yzy, zxz, xzx, yxy, zyz, xyz, yzx, zxy, xzy, yxz, zyx).
        Fully vectorized code, with warnings/errors for Euler angles (singularity, out of range, invalid angle order),
        DCM (orthogonality, not proper, exceeded tolerance to unity determinant) and Euler vectors(not unity).
