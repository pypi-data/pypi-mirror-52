        *Vivid Node* (alias *Rian*) is a free [Python](https://www.python.org/) library
        for next generation machine learning- and data analysis applications, that
        implement *cloud-assisted meta programming*. Rian is part of the
        [Vivid Code](http://www.frootlab.org/vivid) framework and actively developed at
        the [Frootlab](http://www.frootlab.org) Organization.
        
        The key goal of Rian is to automate and support collaborative data science. To
        achieve this goal Rian orchestrates established frameworks like
        [TensorFlowÂ®](https://www.tensorflow.org) or [KerasÂ®](https://keras.io) and
        dynamically extends their capabilities by cloud based community algorithms.
        Thereby Rian allows the usage of abstract defined algorithms, that are specified
        with respect to their category, the used data type and an evaluation metric.
        During runtime these abstract specifications are resolved cloud-sided by
        *currently best fitting* algorithm, that match the specification. This allows
        the separation of engineering and data science, as well as simple collaborations
        between organizations without the requirement to share data.

        For a given algorithm category and data type, the currently best fitting
        algorithms are determined by the used metric. Examples for such metrices would
        be the prediction accuracies within a fixed set of gold standard samples of the
        respective domain of application (e.g. latin handwriting, spoken words, TCGA
        gene expression data, etc.).
        
        Current Development Status
        --------------------------
        
        Rian currently is in *Pre-Alpha* development stage, which immediately follows
        the *Planning* stage. This means, that at least some essential requirements of
        Rian are not yet implemented.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Comprehensive information and installation support is provided within the
        [online manual](http://docs.frootlab.org/rian). If you already have a
        Python environment configured on your computer, you can install the latest
        distributed version by using pip:
        
            $ pip install rian
        
        Or alternatively:
        
            $ pip install vivid-node
        
        Documentation
        -------------
        
        The documentation of the latest distributed version is available as an [online
        manual](http://docs.frootlab.org/rian) and for download, given in the
        formats [PDF](https://readthedocs.org/projects/rian/downloads/pdf/latest/),
        [EPUB](https://readthedocs.org/projects/rian/downloads/epub/latest/) and
        [HTML](https://readthedocs.org/projects/rian/downloads/htmlzip/latest/).
