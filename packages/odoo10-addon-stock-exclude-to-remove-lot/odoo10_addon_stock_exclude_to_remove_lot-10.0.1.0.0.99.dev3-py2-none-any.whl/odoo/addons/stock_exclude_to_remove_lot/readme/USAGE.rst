Go to Inventory > Configuration > Warehouse Management > Operation Types
and choose the ones you want to configure.

If you want to restrict lots that have their removal date > Today, check
'Exclude to remove lots'.

So, in picking operations, when you click on 'Split Lot' button, users
won't be able to select lots with removal date <= today.
