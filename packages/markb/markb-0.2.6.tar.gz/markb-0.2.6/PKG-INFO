        Render a markdown file and display it instantly in a browser.
        
        This is a little script that renders a markdown file to a temporary file and
        opens a browser to view it. It was originally intended to quickly look at
        README files from cool cloned GitHub repositories.
        
            # attempt to use any file starting with README
            markb  
        
            -- OR --    
        
            # invoke on a given file
            markb post.md
