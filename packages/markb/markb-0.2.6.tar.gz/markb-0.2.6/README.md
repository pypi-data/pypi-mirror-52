markb
=====

Render a markdown file and display it instantly in a browser.

This is a little script that renders a markdown file to a temporary file and
opens a browser to view it. It was originally intended to quickly look at
README files from cool cloned GitHub repositories.

    # attempt to use any file starting with README
    markb  

    -- OR --    

    # invoke on a given file
    markb post.md
