Description: # Lib Cove OCDS
        
        ## Command line
        
        Call `libcoveocds` and pass the filename of some JSON data.
        
            libcoveocds tests/fixtures/common_checks/basic_1.json
        
        ## Code for use by external users
        
        The only code that should be used directly by users is the `libcoveocds.config` and `libcoveocds.api` modules.
        
        Other code ( Code in `libcore`, `lib`, etc) 
        should not be used by external users of this library directly, as the structure and use of these may change more frequently.
        
        
        ## Updating dependencies
        
        This is a bit messy; because we use two of our own packages and one of them isn't currently in pypi. Sorry.
        
          *  Update setup.py with any requirements this library needs, and update requirements.in if needed.
          *  Perform the usual steps to generate the txt files
          *  Go to the txt files and ...
                *  remove the line that starts "-e git+git@github.com:open-contracting/lib-cove-ocds.git". (This ends up here because of `-e .`, but we need that so the requirements in setup.py are installed.)
                *  remove the two error lines at the top that start "Skipping line in requirement file" and " (add #egg=PackageName to the URL to avoid this warning)"
