    'Deep Belief Networks' are layered feed forward Artificial Neural
    Networks with hidden layers, a symmetric graph structure and
    optimization in two steps. The first step, known as 'pretraining',
    utilizes Restricted Boltzmann Machines as builing blocks to
    initialize the optimization parameters. This allows the introduction
    of energy based weak constraints on direct unit interactions and
    improves the ability to overcome bad local optima. The second step,
    known as 'finetuning', uses a gradient descent by Backpropagation of
    Error to optimize the reconstruction of output data.

    DBNs are typically used for data classification tasks and nonlinear
    dimensionality reduction (1). By using data manipulation tests, DBNs
    can also be utilized to find and analyse nonlinear dependency
    sructures in data.

    Attributes:
        about (str): Short description of the content of the resource.
            Hint: Read- & writeable wrapping attribute to get('about')
                and set('about', str).
        author (str): A person, an organization, or a service that is
            responsible for the creation of the content of the resource.
            Hint: Read- & writeable wrapping attribute to get('author')
                and set('author', str).
        branch (str): Name of a duplicate of the original resource.
            Hint: Read- & writeable wrapping attribute to get('branch')
                and set('branch', str).
        edges (list of str): List of all edges in the network.
            Hint: Readonly wrapping attribute to get('edges')
        email (str): Email address to a person, an organization, or a
            service that is responsible for the content of the resource.

                and set('email', str).
        fullname (str): String concatenation of name, branch and
            version. Branch and version are only conatenated if they
            exist.

            permission to do something with the resource.
            Hint: Read- & writeable wrapping attribute to get('license')
                and set('license', str).
        name (str): Name of the resource.

            of the instance.
            Hint: Readonly wrapping attribute to get('type')
        version (int): Versionnumber of the resource.
            Hint: Read- & writeable wrapping attribute to get('version')
                and set('version', int).
