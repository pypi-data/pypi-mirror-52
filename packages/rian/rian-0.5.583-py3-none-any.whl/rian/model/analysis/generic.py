"""Propabilistic Graphical Model (PGM) analysis.

This module includes generic functions for the analysis of probabilistic
graphical models.

The supported categories of analysis functions are:

    (1) Sampler: Matrix valued statistical inference functions
        Returns numpy arrays of shape (d, n), where n is the number of
        target observables and d the size of the sample.
    (2) Sample statistics: Vectorial statistical inference functions
        Returns numpy arrays of shape (1, n), where n is the number of
        target observables
    (3) Objective functions: Scalar statistical inference functions
        Returns scalar value, that can be used to determin local optima
    (4) Association measures: Matrix valued statistical association measures
        Returns numpy arrays of shape (n, n), where n is the number of
        observables
