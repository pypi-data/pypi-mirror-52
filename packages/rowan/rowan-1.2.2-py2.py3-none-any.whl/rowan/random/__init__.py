Various functions for generating random sets of rotation quaternions. Note
that if you simply want random quaternions not restricted to :math:`SO(3)` you
can just generate these directly using ``np.random.rand(... 4)``. This
subpackage is entirely focused on generating rotation quaternions.

        Random quaternions of the shape provided with an additional axis of
        length 4.

    R"""Generate random rotations uniformly

    In general, sampling from the space of all quaternions will not generate
    uniform rotations. What we want is a distribution that accounts for the
    density of rotations, *i.e.*, a distribution that is uniform with respect
    to the appropriate measure. The algorithm used here is detailed in
    [Shoe92]_.
