## How to install

Installation can be done with a single command:

## How to use

Setup in your project is easy. Just add it to your installed apps:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    . . .
    'django_oidc_user',
]
```

And you will need to set it as your default User model, so add the following line to your settings:
