FMI-compliant Model Estimation in Python
========================================

Description
-----------

**modestpy** facilitates parameter estimation in models compliant with
`Functional Mock-up Interface <https://fmi-standard.org/>`__.

Features:

- combination of global and local search methods (genetic algorithm, pattern search, truncated Newton method, L-BFGS-B, sequential least squares),
- suitable also for non-continuous and non-differentiable models,
- compatible with both Python 2.7 and 3 (tested up to 3.5).

Installation with conda (recommended)
-------------------------------------

It is now possible to install ModestPy through ``conda``:

::

   conda config --add channels conda-forge
   conda install modestpy

Installation with conda and pip
-------------------------------

This procedure has been tested on Debian 9 and Ubuntu 16.04 with Python 3.

It is advised to use ``conda`` to install the required dependencies.
``modestpy`` itself can be installed using ``pip`` inside the ``conda`` environment.

Create separate environment (optional):

::

    conda create --name modestpy
    conda activate modestpy

Install dependencies:

::

    conda install scipy pandas numpy matplotlib
    conda install -c chria pyfmi
    conda install -c conda-forge pydoe

Install ``modestpy``:

::

    python -m pip install modestpy

Installation with pip
---------------------

This procedure has been tested on Windows 7 with Python 2.

Install ``pyfmi`` as part of `JModelica <http://www.jmodelica.org/>`__.

To install ``modestpy`` use ``pip`` (other dependencies will be installed automatically):

::

    python -m pip install modestpy

To get the latest development version download directly from GitHub repository:

::

    python -m pip install https://github.com/sdu-cfei/modest-py/archive/master.zip

Note, that JModelica installs Python and libraries in a separate directory than the standard Python distribution. Therefore either the path to those libraries needs to be added to PYTHONPATH or ModestPy needs to be installed inside the JModelica distribution.

Test your installation
----------------------

The unit tests will work only if you installed modestpy with conda or cloned the project from GitHub. To run tests:

.. code:: python

    >>> from modestpy.test import run
    >>> run.tests()

or

::

    cd <project_directory>
    python ./bin/test.py


Usage
-----

Users are supposed to call only the high level API included in
``modestpy.Estimation``. The API is fully discussed in `this
wiki <https://github.com/sdu-cfei/modest-py/wiki/modestpy-API>`__. You
can also check out this `simple example </examples/simple>`__. The basic
usage is as follows:

.. code:: python

    >>> from modestpy import Estimation
    >>> session = Estimation(workdir, fmu_path, inp, known, est, ideal)
    >>> estimates = session.estimate()
    >>> err, res = session.validate()

More control is possible via optional arguments, as discussed in the `documentation 
<https://github.com/sdu-cfei/modest-py/wiki/modestpy-API>`__.

``modestpy`` automatically saves results in the working
directory including csv files with estimates and some useful plots,
e.g.:

1) Error evolution in combined GA+PS estimation (dots represent switch
   from GA to PS): |Error-evolution|

2) Visualization of GA evolution: |GA-evolution|

3) Scatter matrix plot for interdependencies between parameters:
   |Intedependencies|
