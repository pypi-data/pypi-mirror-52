This is a library to get information in device manager on Windows10 based on WMI.

You can get almost all information of device manager via this library.  
For example, "BIOS Device Name", "Driver INF Path" and so on.

## How to use

Use files in `wmidevicemanager` directory.

You need to install `comtypes` library.

```python
import wmidevicemanager
wmi = wmidevicemanager.WmiDeviceManager()
for x in wmi:
    print(x.DeviceID)

pci_root = next(x for x in wmi if x.BiosDeviceName == r"\_SB.PCI0")
for child in pci_root.children:
    print(child.DeviceID)

for device in wmi:
    if device.BiosDeviceName == r"\_SB.PCI0.RP01.PXSX" or device.BiosDeviceName == r"\_SB.PCI0.RP02.PXSX":
        device.Disable()
```
