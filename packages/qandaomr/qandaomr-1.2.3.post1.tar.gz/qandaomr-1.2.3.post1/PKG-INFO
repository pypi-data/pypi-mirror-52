Description: # OMR
        ![](https://github.com/Jojojoppe/OMR/workflows/Build/badge.svg)
        
        This package can create a form which can be read in with OMR and can read those forms.
        
        ## Usage
        ### Creating an OMR form
        To create an OMR enabled form you must make a form (with Word, LaTeX or similar software) and mark the first bullet points with a **red** background and the last with a **green** background. At last the corners should be marked: the bottom right corner must be marked with a black square and the three other corners with a QR code like corner. At this moment the user must do this themselfes (this may change in the future). The imput to OMR must be an image file.

        Running the following will generate a printable output sheet with barcodes at the bottom which OMR uses to detect the settings
        ```
        qandaomr -c input_file output_file columns rows points_per_question questions_per_block
        ```
        ![Created omr form](/img/form_r.png)
        
        ### Reading an OMR form
        To get the answers back from the form a scanned image can be the input to OMR. OMR will print the answers to the terminal in a CSV format.
        ```
        qandaomr -r input_file
        ```
        
        ### Generating intermediate files
        For debug purposes the `-d` flag can be used. This will generate multiple images which are used in the steps within OMR. This can be useful if OMR does not react the way it should
