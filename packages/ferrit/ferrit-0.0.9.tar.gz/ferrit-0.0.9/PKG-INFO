        A stupid tool for listing and checking out Gerrit changes
        
        ## Getting started
        
        ### Installation
        
        Install with pip
        ```
        pip3 install --user ferrit
        ```
        or from the repo
        ```
        python3 setup.py install --user
        ```
        
        ### Configuration
        
        There (currently) is none. Ferrit assumes that...
        - You're using HTTP to talk to Gerrit
        - The remote you want to use is `origin`
        - Your HTTP credentials are stored in ~/.git-credentials
        - You feel no desire to verify SSL certificates
        
        ### Usage
        
        Ferrit can be accessed both with the `ferrit` and `fe` command.
        
        List relevant changes:
        ```
        fe dashboard
        ```
        
        Checkout the latest patch set of change 123:
        ```
        fe checkout 123
        ```
        
        Checkout patch set 45 of change 123:
        ```
        fe checkout 123/45
        ```
        
        Search for changes containing the words `foo` and `bar`
        ```
        fe search foo bar
        ```
