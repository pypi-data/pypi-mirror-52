# mipeapy: mipea Python wrapper

## Under construction

This Python module makes use of the mipea library to access the peripherals
of the Raspberry Pi. The module is written in C and uses the Python C API.
Most functions are just wrappers to the mipea functions with conversion to
Python objects and some improvments.
