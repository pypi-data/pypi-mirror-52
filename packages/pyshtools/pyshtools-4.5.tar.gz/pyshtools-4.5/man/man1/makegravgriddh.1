.SH Description
.PP
\f[C]MakeGravGridDH\f[R] will create 2-dimensional cylindrical maps from
the spherical harmonic coefficients \f[C]cilm\f[R], equally sampled
(\f[C]n\f[R] by \f[C]n\f[R]) or equally spaced (\f[C]n\f[R] by
2\f[C]n\f[R]) in latitude and longitude, for the three vector components
of the gravity field, the magnitude of the gravity field, and the
potential (all using geocentric coordinates).
The gravitational potential is given by
.PP
\f[C]V = GM/r Sum_{l=0}\[ha]lmax (r0/r)\[ha]l Sum_{m=-l}\[ha]l C_{lm} Y_{lm}\f[R],
.PP
and the gravitational acceleration is
.PP
\f[C]B = Grad V\f[R].
.PP
The coefficients are referenced to a radius \f[C]r0\f[R], and the
function is computed on a flattened ellipsoid with semi-major axis
\f[C]a\f[R] (i.e., the mean equatorial radius) and flattening
\f[C]f\f[R].
All grids are output in SI units, and the sign of the radial components
is positive when directed upwards.
If the optional angular rotation rate \f[C]omega\f[R] is specified, the
potential and radial gravitational acceleration will be calculated in a
body-fixed rotating reference frame.
.PP
To remove the \[lq]normal gravity\[rq] (the total gravitational
acceleration on the ellipsoid) from the magnitude of the total gravity
field (to obtain the \[lq]gravity disturbance\[rq]), set
\f[C]normal_gravity\f[R] to 1.
To convert m/s\[ha]2 to mGals, multiply the gravity grids by 10\[ha]5.
.PP
The calculated values should be considered exact only when the radii on
the ellipsoid are greater than the maximum radius of the planet (the
potential coefficients are simply downward/upward continued in the
spectral domain).
The components of the gravity vector are calculated using spherical
coordinates whose origin is at the center of the planet, and the
components are thus not normal to the reference ellipsoid.
.PP
The default is to calculate grids for use in the Driscoll and Healy
routines that are equally sampled (\f[C]n\f[R] by \f[C]n\f[R]), but this
can be changed to calculate equally spaced grids (\f[C]n\f[R] by
2\f[C]n\f[R]) by setting the optional argument \f[C]sampling\f[R] to 2.
The input value of \f[C]lmax\f[R] determines the number of samples,
\f[C]n=2lmax+2\f[R], and the latitudinal sampling interval,
90/(\f[C]lmax\f[R]+1).
The first latitudinal band of the grid corresponds to 90 N, the
latitudinal band for 90 S is not calculated, and the latitudinal
sampling interval is 180/\f[C]n\f[R] degrees.
The first longitudinal band is 0 E, the longitudinal band for 360 E is
not calculated, and the longitudinal sampling interval is
360/\f[C]n\f[R] for equally sampled and 180/\f[C]n\f[R] for equally
spaced grids, respectively.
