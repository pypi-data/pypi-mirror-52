.SH DHaj
.PP
Compute the latitudinal weights used in the Driscoll and Healy (1994)
spherical harmonic transform.
.SH Usage
.PP
call DHaj (\f[C]n\f[R], \f[C]aj\f[R], \f[C]exitstatus\f[R])
.SH Parameters
.TP
.B \f[C]n\f[R] : input, integer
The number of samples in latitude used in the spherical harmonic
transform.
This must be even.
.TP
.B \f[C]aj\f[R] : output, real/*8
The latitudinal weights used in the spherical harmonic transform.
.TP
.B \f[C]exitstatus\f[R] : output, optional, integer
If present, instead of executing a STOP when an error is encountered,
the variable exitstatus will be returned describing the error.
0 = No errors; 1 = Improper dimensions of input array; 2 = Improper
bounds for input variable; 3 = Error allocating memory; 4 = File IO
error.
.SH Description
.PP
\f[C]DHaj\f[R] will calculate the latitudinal weights used in the
spherical harmonic transform of Driscoll and Healy (1994; equation 9).
The number of samples \f[C]n\f[R] must be even, and the transform and
its inverse are implemented as \f[C]SHExpandDH\f[R] and
\f[C]MakeGridDH\f[R], respectively.
It is noted that the first element, corresponding to the north pole, is
always zero.
The element corresponding to the south pole is not included.
