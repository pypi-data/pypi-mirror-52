        Using this package is very simple
        ### Prerequisites
        
        The testing capability of the package requires unittest and nose to run.
        Sorting functions do not require any other additional packages.
        
        ```
        alist = [54, 26, 93, 17, 77, 31, 44, 55, 20]
        print(bubbleSort(alist))
        ```
        
        ### Installing
        
        Install directly from PyPI using
        
        ```
        pip install sorting
        ```
        
        
        ## Running the tests
        
        You can just run 'test' on the setup file
        
        ```
        $ python setup.py test
        ```
