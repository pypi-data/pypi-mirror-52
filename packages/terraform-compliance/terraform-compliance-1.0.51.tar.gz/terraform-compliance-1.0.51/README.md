## Quick Overview
- __compliance:__ Ensure the implemented code is following security standards, your own custom standards
- __behaviour driven development:__ We have BDD for nearly everything, why not for IaC ?
- __portable:__ just install it from `pip` or run it via `docker`
- __why ?:__ why not ?

## Support

`terraform-compliance` had a huge revamp/redesign following `terraform`'s huge change coming with 0.12 version. 
Due to these breaking changes `terraform-compliance` `1.0.0+` versions only supports terraform `0.12+` versions.  

Older `terraform` versions is supported with 0.6.4 with limited functionality. Please use it with your own risk, since older versions of `terraform-compliance` (0.6.4 and older) is discontinued.

## Changelog

All changes coming with 1.0.0 and further versions can be found in [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/eerkunt/terraform-compliance/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## Usage

Recommended way to use `terraform-compliance` is using it's [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/eerkunt/terraform-compliance/) image.

Just define it as a function in your shell ;
```commandline
[~] $ function terraform-compliance { docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/target -i -t eerkunt/terraform-compliance "$@"; }
```
and use it wherever you want that has docker installed.

```commandline
[~] $ terraform-compliance -h

    --version, -v         show program's version number and exit
```

`terraform-compliance` is also available via `PyPi` package, so you can also install and use it via ;
```commandline
[~] $ pip install terraform-compliance
```

## How to use

```diff
-THIS IS ONLY APPLICABLE FOR 1.0.0+ VERSIONS
```
`terraform-compliance` requires a valid `terraform` plan file that is generated by terraform.

In order to do that you should add `-out=plan.out` to your `terraform plan` executions like ;

```
terraform plan -out=plan.out
``` 

This will create a propriety plan file that `terraform` can read also on `apply` operations.

After having your `plan.out` ( or any filename that is suitable for you ) created, you can run your `terraform-compliance` tests via ;

```
terraform-compliance -f /path/to/bdd/files -p /path/to/plan.out
```

#### Another Use Case: "I don't want to plan but want to scan my state file, current environment"

Just run ;

```
terraform show -json > state.out
```

which will generate a similar file to `plan.out` (as `state.out` in this example) that can be read by `terraform-compliance`

```
terraform-compliance -f /path/to/bdd/files -p /path/to/state.out
```

## Features

### Terraform Interpolations and Modules
`terraform-compliance` v1.0.0+ has full support for all terraform interpolations and modules, unlike to older versions.
]
### Compliance Tests

The idea of `terraform-compliance` is to define compliance-as-code in BDD fashion where compliance against infrastructure-as-code
is defined in a human readable format which makes the life easier to understand what is being tested and failed/passed.

Ideally, the tools needs to be integrated with a CI/CD tool and runs on every build - where you can define the scope like
* Company wide compliance-as-code
* Project wide compliance-as-code

`terraform-compliance` does not require any target environment to run. It runs against `terraform` plan outputs or state files, 
depending on your use case. Thus it is a stage that needs to run before any deployment (**PRE-COMPLIANCE**). 

Here is a quick DEMO about how does it look like when it runs to a sample `plan.out`

![Example Run](terraform-compliance-demo.gif)

### BDD Directives
Every BDD feature file will have ;

- Feature
- Scenario/Scenario Outline
- Steps

##### Feature
This draws the overall picture of the feature file that may consist several scenarios.

For e.g. ;

```cucumber
Feature: Security Groups should be used to protect services/instances
  In order to improve security
  As engineers
  We'll use AWS Security Groups as a Perimeter Defence
```

This won't effect anything about the test steps, but it will ease the pain for everybody to understand what does that feature aims for.

##### Scenario
Every feature might have multiple scenarios. A scenario will define a test that might include multiple steps with BDD directives like ;

- GIVEN
- WHEN
- THEN

and every step might also have an additional extension step starting with ;
- AND

There are two types of Scenario ;

- Scenario : Used for defining a scenario without any multiple dynamic variables.
- Scenario Outline : Used for defining a scenario loops by giving multiple dynamic variables.

##### Steps
Steps are the functional tests that is actually executing necessary task to validate if the test is successful or not.

`terraform-compliance` has fixed steps already defined within the tool. It is possible to drill down your terraform resources by using these fixed steps.

###### Available Steps

| BDD Conditions | Step Sentence | Parameters | 
| ---------------| --------------| ---------- |
| GIVEN          | I have `{name}` `{type}` configured | `name`: name of the key in terraform (e.g. `aws_security_group`, `aws`) (In order to define all resources you can use `a resource`, `any resource`, `a`, `any`, `anything`) <br>`type`: The type of the key (e.g. `resource(s)`, `provider(s)`, `data(s)` or `variable(s)`) |
| GIVEN          | I have `{resource_name}` defined | `name`: name of the resource ( e.g. `aws_security_group` ) |
| WHEN           | I `{math_formula}` them | `action`: `math_formula` |
| WHEN           | its `{key}` is `{value}`<br>its `{key}` has `{value}`<br>its `{key}` contains `{value}`<br>its `{key}` includes `{value}`  | `key`: any property that resource have (e.g. name, address, etc. ) `address` will give the terraform object name<br>`value`: any string or numeric value that the property has.<br>_Found resources from previous step will be filtered based on these values._ |
| WHEN           | its `{key}` is not `{value}`<br>its `{key}` has not `{value}`<br>its `{key}` does not contain `{value}`<br>its `{key}` does not include `{value}`  | `key`: any property that resource have (e.g. name, address, etc. ) `address` will give the terraform object name<br>`value`: any string, bool or numeric value that the property has.<br>_Found resources from previous step will be filtered based on these values._ |
| THEN           | I expect the result is `{operator}` than/to `{number}`<br>Its value must be `{operator}` than/to `{number}` | `operator`: `more`, `more and equal`, `less`, `less and equal`, `equal`<br>`number`: an integer |
| WHEN<br>THEN   | it contain `{something}`<br>it contains `{something}`<br>it must contain `{something}` | `something`: any property within terraform resoruce/provider/etc. (e.g. `access_key`, `ingress` ) |
| THEN           | `{property}` is enabled<br>`{property}` must be enabled | `property`: can be either a generic property from your terraform configuration or templated ones like below for some resources;<br>* `encryption at rest`<br>* `encrytion in flight`|
| THEN           | its value `{condition}` match the "`{search_regex}`" regex | `condition`: `must` or `must not`<br>`search_regex`: the regular expression of the searching value |
| THEN           | its value `{condition}` be `{value}` | `condition`: `must` or `must not`<br>`value`: the matching value |
| WHEN<br>THEN   | its value must be set by a variable | |
| THEN           | it must `{condition}` have `{proto}` protocol and port `{port}` for `{cidr}` | `{condition}`: only,not<br>`proto`: tcp, udp<br>`port`: integer port number (or a port range by using `-` delimeter between port ranges [e.g. 80-84])<br>`cidr`: IP/Cidr |
| THEN           | its value `{condition}` contain `{value}` | `{condition}`: `must` or `must not`, `value`: the item to look for in the list |
| THEN           | the scenario fails<br>the scenario should fail<br>it fails<br>it should fail<br>it must fail | None |
| THEN           | its value '{condition}' be null | 'condition': 'must' or 'must not' |

Every condition can also be used to drill down more in the terraform code by utilising `AND` directive.

Any step consisting `GIVEN` and `WHEN` directives will lead to skip the whole scenario if one of those steps fails. `THEN` directive does not lead any scenario/step skipping, so if the step fails, whole scenario fails.

For e.g. ;
```cucumber
  Scenario: TLS enforcement on ELB resources
    Given I have AWS ELB resource defined
    When it contains listener
    Then it must contain ssl_certificate_id
```

To explain this, it is better to explain this by checking an example terraform code ;

```
resource "aws_elb" "some_elb" {
    name            = "My gorgeous ELB name"
    subnets         = "${var.subnet_ids}"
    security_groups = ["${aws_security_group.some_elb_sg.id}"]

    listener {
        instance_port      = 8084
        instance_protocol  = "https"
        lb_port            = 8084
        lb_protocol        = "https"
        ssl_certificate_id = "${module.acm-cert-elb.acm_cert_arn}"
    }
}
```
We are trying to create an AWS ELB Instance with SSL Certificates created from a module. 
The test steps will first run ;

```cucumber
Given I have AWS ELB resource defined
```
which will locate the resorce named `aws_elb` among all other resources ( please have a look [Naming Conventions](https://github.com/eerkunt/terraform-compliance/blob/c59c5014a703640dfbf161b5119907036610ffef/terraform_compliance/steps/__init__.py#L18) if you are not sure how `AWS ELB` transformed into `aws_elb` ) and then push the data to the step below ;

```cucumber
When it contains listener
```

Then it will drill down the `listener` definition within the HCL. If found, then the data within `listener` will be pushed on the next step.

*Till this point, if any of the steps fail, the further steps will be SKIPPED.*

For the last step ;
```cucumber
Then it must contain ssl_certificate_id
```
Here it will check within the data coming from the parent step if there is `ssl_certificate_id` defined within. This step is critical since it defines if the scenario will fail or pass.

###### Scenario Loops

It is also possible to use scenario loops. Please note that, `Scenario Outline` needs to be used instead of `Scenario`
.

```
Scenario Outline: Well-known insecure protocol exposure on Public Network for ingress traffic
    Given I have AWS Security Group defined
  	When it contains ingress
    Then it must not have <proto> protocol and port <portNumber> for 0.0.0.0/0

  Examples:
    | ProtocolName | proto | portNumber |
    | HTTP         | tcp   | 443       |
    | Telnet       | tcp   | 23         |
    | SSH          | tcp   | 22         |
    | MySQL        | tcp   | 3306       |
    | MSSQL        | tcp   | 1443       |
    | NetBIOS      | tcp   | 139        |
    | RDP          | tcp   | 3389       |
    | Jenkins Slave| tcp   | 50000      |
```



# Examples
Just as a sample to show the capabilities, `terraform-compliance` repository includes [a sample of tests](https://github.com/eerkunt/terraform-compliance/tree/master/example/example_01/aws).

These sample tests include ;

* Checks if encryption at rest is applied
* Checks if encryption in flight is applied
* Checks if naming standards are applied based on a specific format
* Checks if tagging is applied for applicable resources following the standards
* Checks if there are number of subnets defined in the terraform code for a multi-layered architecture
* Checks if there are some specific ports are not allowed for specific subnets in Security Groups
* Checks if API Keys/Credentials are not used within the code.
* Checks/Filters for a specific resource rather than a resource type.
* Checks if specific resource types should not be created.
* Checks if S3 Public Block access is enforces.

The tests can be easily extended with the current capabilities. For any new capability please raise [a new Issue](https://github.com/eerkunt/terraform-compliance/issues/new) and it will be implemented as soon as possible.

### Using git repositories for features
`terraform-compliance` also supports remote fetching if any of the feature or terraform files exist in a remote git repo. Sample usage is like ;

```commandline
[~] $ terraform-compliance -f git:https://some.git.repository/compliance-code.git -p /path/to/plan.out
```

If you already configured your `~/.ssh/config` and pointing remote host, and private key file, you don't even need to
use `-i` argument, it will be used automatically.


### Argument passing

You can also push additional arguments that is specific for `radish`. Just to explain how it works ;

For e.g.
```bash
[~] $ terraform-compliance -f /path/to/features -t /path/to/terraform_files -v
terraform-compliance v1.0.0 initiated
...
...
...
Running tests.
0.13.0  <--- This is coming from radish directly.
```
Please note that `0.13.0` is the `radish` version comes from `-v` parameter.

## FAQ

- __Q.__ Where are the steps defined ?
