.. START_OF_ABOUT_IMPORT

Bringing together Medical Physicists to create quality transparent software at
a price affordable by all our peers (free)

PyMedPhys, a community powered by git and continuous integration. A place to
share, review, improve, and transparently learn off of each otherâ€™s code. 

It is a library of tools that we all have access to and, because of its
`license`_, will all have access to whatever it becomes in the future.
It is inspired by the collaborative work of our physics peers in
astronomy and their `Astropy Project`_.

.. _`Astropy Project`: http://www.astropy.org/

.. _`license`: https://choosealicense.com/licenses/agpl-3.0/


This package is available on `PyPI`_, `GitHub`_ and `conda-forge`_. You
can access the Documentation `here <https://pymedphys.com>`__.

PyMedPhys is currently within the ``beta`` stage of its lifecycle. It will
stay in this stage until the version number leaves ``0.x.x`` and enters
``1.x.x``. While PyMedPhys is in ``beta`` stage, **no API is guaranteed to be
stable from one release to the next.** In fact, it is very likely that the
entire API will change multiple times before a ``1.0.0`` release. In practice,
this means that upgrading ``pymedphys`` to a new version will possibly break
any code that was using the old version of pymedphys. We try to be abreast of
this by providing details of any breaking changes from one release to the next
within the `Release Notes
<http://pymedphys.com/getting-started/changelog.html>`__.

We want you on this list. We want you, whether you are a  clinical
Medical Physicist, PhD or Masters student, researcher, or even just
someone with an interest in Python to join our team. We want you if you
have a desire to create and validate a toolbox we can all use to improve
how we care for our patients.

The aim of PyMedPhys is that it will be developed by an open community
of contributors. We use a shared copyright model that enables all
contributors to maintain the copyright on their contributions. All code
