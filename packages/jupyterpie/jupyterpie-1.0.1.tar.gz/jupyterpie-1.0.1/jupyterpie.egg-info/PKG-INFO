Description: # jupyterpie
        
        ### Installation
        
        ```
        pip install jupyterpie
        ```
        
        ### Usage
        ```
        jupyterpie <path to ipynb file>
        ```
        
        The python file will have the same name with a .py extension.
        
        ### Why use jupyterpie?
        
        While most libraries do not preserve cell outputs from Jupyter when converting to a py file, jupyterpie will store these outputs as comments. It is particularly useful if you regularly upload .ipynb files to Github because Github often fails to render .ipynb files.
