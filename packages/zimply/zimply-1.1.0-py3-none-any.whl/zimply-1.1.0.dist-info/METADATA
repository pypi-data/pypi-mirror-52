ZIMply is an easy to use, offline reader for Wikipedia - as well as other ZIM files - which provides access to them through any ordinary browser. ZIMply is written entirely in Python 3 and, as the name implies, relies on ZIM files. Each ZIM file is a bundle containing thousands of articles, images, etc. as found on websites such as Wikipedia. ZIMply does all the unpacking for you, and allows you to access the offline Wikipedia right from your web browser by running its own web server.
