Description: # Python interface for OSCAR data
        
        This is a convenience library to access OSCAR dataset. 
        Since everything is stored in local files it won't work unless you have access 
        to one of OSCAR servers.
        
        **IMPORTANT:** all servers have access to each other's data through NFS, which is
        subject to network delays and failures.
        So, for faster access this module assumes you're working on **da4**, where all the
        files are stored.
        
        ### Installation
        
            # pip is not available on OSCAR servers
            easy_install --user --upgrade oscar
        
        ### Reference
