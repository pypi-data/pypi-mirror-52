Description: # gri : Gerrit Reduced Interface
        
        `gri`[¹](#f11) is a CLI tool that will list your open git reviews from multiple servers
        in a way that makes easier to to identify which one need.

        ## Features
        * multiple Gerrit servers
        * change number and topics are clickable links
        * draft/dnm/wip changes are grayed out
        
        ## Wishlist
        
        * Configurable Gerrit servers
        * Sorting :: top ones should be those closer to be merged
        * Grouping
        * Caching
        * Dependency graph based on zuul Depends-On
        * Configurable query
        * Include starred changes
        * Zuul build status support
        * top mode :: so it can auto-refresh and notify you of important changes
        
        ## Installing
        ```
        pip install gri
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        Currently the tool loads gerrit servers defined in [`~/.gertty.yaml`][1] but
        uses credentials from `~/.netrc` file.
        
        So use it just run `gli`, or `python -m gri`.
        
        ## Contributing
        Are you missing a feature, just check if there is a bug open for it and add
        a new one if not. Once done, you are welcomed to make a PR that implements
        the missing change.
        
        ## Related tools
        * [GerTTY](https://github.com/openstack/gertty) is a very useful tui for gerrit
        which inspired me but which presents one essential design limitation: it does
        not work with multiple Gerrit servers.
        
        ## Notes
        1. <span id="f1"></span> The reality is that `gri` name comes from my attempt to
        find a short namespace on pypi that was starting with g (from Gerrit) and
        preferably sounds like `cli`, most were taken. You are welcomed to propose
        better acronym expansions.
