Description: ## vcfsyncer: A package to synchronize multiple VCFs
        This is a way to transparently use single sample VCFs as if they were a
        multi-sample VCF.
        
        ### Installation
        The simplest way to install vcfsyncer is through pip:
        ```sh
        pip install vcfsyncer
        ```
        
        ### Usage
        Use vcfsyncer within a python environment
        ```python
        
        from vcfsyncer import VCFSyncer
        
        synced = VCFSyncer(PATH_A, PATH_B, PATH_C)
        
        # you can iterate through the synchronized VCFs
        for var in synced:
            print(var.chrom, var.pos)
        
        # alternatively, fetch regions from the synchronized VCFs (if tabix-indexed)
        for var in synced.fetch(chrom='1', start=1000000, end=2000000):
            print(var.chrom, var.pos)
        ```
