Description: # Data Analysis Library Sharks
        
        This repository contains a detailed note of a new data analysis library Sharks.
        
        
        
        ## Objectives
        
        Sharks :
        
        * Has A DataFrame class with data stored in numpy arrays
        * Can Select subsets of data with the brackets operator
        * Can Use special methods defined in the Python data model
        * Have a nicely formatted display of the DataFrame in the notebook
        * Can Implement aggregation methods - sum, min, max, mean, median, etc...
        * Can Implement non-aggregation methods such as isna, unique, rename, drop
        * Can Group by one or two columns
        * Have methods specific to string columns
        * Can Read in data from a comma-separated value file
        
        
        
        ## Functionalities of Sharks
        
        
        ### 1. DataFrame constructor input types
        
        Our DataFrame class is constructed with a single parameter.
        
        Specifically, input types must qualify the following:
        
        * Sharks will raise a `TypeError` if `data` is not a dictionary
        * Sharks will raise a `TypeError` if the keys of `data` are not strings
        * Sharks will raise a `TypeError` if the values of `data` are not numpy arrays
        * Sharks will raise a `ValueError` if the values of `data` are not 1-dimensional
        
        
        
        
        ### 2. Array lengths
        
        We are now guaranteed that `data` is a dictionary of strings mapped to one-dimensional arrays. Each column of data in our DataFrame must have the same number of elements. 
        
        ### 3. Convert unicode arrays to object
        
        Whenever you create a numpy array of Python strings, it will default the data type of that array to unicode. Take a look at the following simple numpy array created from strings. Its data type, found in the `dtype` attribute is shown to be 'U' plus the length of the longest string.
        
        ```python
        >>> a = np.array(['cat', 'dog', 'snake'])
        >>> a.dtype
        dtype('<U5')
        ```
        
        Unicode arrays are more difficult to manipulate and don't have the flexibility that we desire. So, if our user passes us a Unicode array, we will convert it to a data type called 'object'. This is a flexible type and will help us later when creating methods just for string columns. Technically, this data type allows any Python objects within the array.
        
        
        ### 4. Find the number of rows in the DataFrame with the `len` function
        
        The number of rows are returned when passing a pandas DataFrame to the builtin `len` function.
        
        
        ### 5. Return columns as a list
        
         `df.columns` will return a list of the column names.
        
        
        ### 6. Set new column names
        
        we can assign all new columns to our DataFrame by setting the columns property equal to a list. A example below shows how you would set new columns for a 3-column DataFrame.
        
        ```python
        df.columns = ['state', 'age', 'fruit']
        ```
        
        Also Sharks will raise errors if the data that is inserted is invalid.
        
        * Sharks will Raise a `TypeError` if the object used to set new columns is not a list
        * Sharks will Raise a `ValueError` if the number of column names in the list does not match the current DataFrame
        * Sharks will Raise a `TypeError` if any of the columns are not strings
        * Sharks will Raise a `ValueError` if any of the column names are duplicated in the list
        
        
        
        ### 7. The `shape` property
        
        The `shape` property will return a two-item tuple of the number of rows and columns. 
        
        
        ### 8. Visual HTML representation in the notebook with the `_repr_html_` method
        
        
        The `_repr_html_` method is made available to developers by iPython so that your objects can have nicely formatted HTML displays within Jupyter Notebooks. Read more on this method [here in the iPython documentation][12] along with other similar methods for different representations.
        
        
        ### 9. The `values` property
        
        `values` is a property that returns a single array of all the columns of data. 
        
        
        ### 10. The `dtypes` property
        
        The `dtypes` property will return a two-column DataFrame with the column names in the first column and their data type as a string in the other. Use 'Column Name' and 'Data Type' as column names.
        
        
        ### 11. Select a single column with the brackets
        
        In Sharks, you can select a single column with `df['colname']`.
        
        ### 12. Select multiple columns with a list
        
        Sharks will also be able to select multiple columns if given a list within the brackets. For example, `df[['colname1', 'colname2']]` will return a two column DataFrame.
        
        ### 13. Boolean Selection with a DataFrame
        
        In Sharks, you can filter for specific rows of a DataFrame by passing in a boolean Series/array to the brackets. For instance, the following will select only the rows such that `a` is greater than 10.
        
        ```python
        >>> s = df['a'] > 10
        >>> df[s]
        ```
        
        
        ### 14. Check for simultaneous selection of rows and columns
        
        
        
        ### 15. Select a single cell of data
        
        Sharks can select a single cell of data with `df[rs, cs]`. We will assume `rs` is an integer and `cs` is either an integer or a string.
        
        
        ### 16. Simultaneously select rows as booleans, lists, or slices
        
        Sharks can select rows and columns simultaneously with `df[rs, cs]`. We will allow `rs` to be either a single-column boolean DataFrame, a list of integers, or a slice. 
        
        ### 17. Simultaneous selection with multiple columns as a list
        
        
        ### 18.  Simultaneous selection with column slices
        
        Sharks will allow  columns to be sliced with either strings or integers. The following selections will be acceptable.
        
        
        ### 19. Tab Completion for column names
        
        
        ### 20. Create a new column or overwrite an old column
        
        
        ### 21. `head` and `tail` methods
        
        The `head` and `tail` methods each accept a single integer parameter `n` which is defaulted to 5. 
        
        ### 22. Generic aggregation methods
        
        Sharks can implement several methods that perform an aggregation. These methods all return a single value for each column. The following aggregation methods are defined.
        
        * min
        * max
        * mean
        * median
        * sum
        * var
        * std
        * all
        * any
        * argmax - index of the maximum
        * argmin - index of the minimum
        
        
        ### 23. `isna` method
        
        The `isna` method will return a DataFrame the same shape as the original but with boolean values for every single value. Each value will be tested whether it is missing or not. Use `np.isnan` except in the case for strings which you can use a vectorized equality expression to `None`.
        
        ### 24. `count` method
        
        The `count` method returns a single-row DataFrame with the number of non-missing values for each column. You will want to use the result of `isna`.
        
        
        
        ### 25. `unique` method
        
        This method will return the unique values for each column in the DataFrame. Specifically, it will return a list of one-column DataFrames of unique values in each column. If there is a single column, just return the DataFrame.
        
        
        
        ### 26. `nunique` method
        
        Return a single-row DataFrame with the number of unique values for each column.
        
        
        ### 27. `value_counts` method
        
        
        ### 28. Normalize options for `value_counts`
        
        
        ### 29. `rename` method
        
        The `rename` method renames one or more column names. Accept a dictionary of old column names mapped to new column names. Return a DataFrame. Raise a `TypeError` if `columns` is not a dictionary.
        
        
        
        ### 30. `drop` method
        
        Accept a single string or a list of column names as strings. Return a DataFrame without those columns. Raise a `TypeError` if a string or list is not provided.
        
        
        
        ### 31. Non-aggregation methods
        
        There are several non-aggregation methods that function similarly. All of the following non-aggregation methods return a DataFrame that is the same shape as the origin.
        
        * `abs`
        * `cummin`
        * `cummax`
        * `cumsum`
        * `clip`
        * `round`
        * `copy`
        
        
        
        
        
        ### 32. Arithmetic and Comparison Operators
        
        All the common arithmetic and comparison operators will be made available to our DataFrame. For example, `df + 5` uses the plus operator to add 5 to each element of the DataFrame. Take a look at some of the following examples:
        
        ```python
        df + 5
        df - 5
        df > 5
        df != 5
        5 + df
        5 < df
        ```
        
        
        ### 33. `sort_values` method
        
        This method will sort the rows of the DataFrame by one or more columns. Allow the parameter `by` to be either a single column name as a string or a list of column names as strings. The DataFrame will be sorted by this column or columns.
        
        
        
        ### 34. `pivot_table` method
        
        
        ### 35. Reading simple CSVs
        
        The `read_csv` function, will read in simple comma-separated value files (CSVs) and return a DataFrame.
