    :param data: The dataset into which the clustering will be performed. The dataset must be 2D np.array with rows as
    examples and columns as features.

    :param eps: Criterion used to define convergence. If the absolute differences between two consecutive losses is
    lower than `eps`, the clustering stop.
    :param max_iter: Criterion used to stop the clustering if the number of iterations exceeds `max_iter`.
    :param weights: Weighting of each features during clustering. Must be an Iterable of weights with the same size as
    the number of features.
    :param initialization_method: Method used to initialise the centroids. Can take one of the following values :
    * "random_uniform" or "uniform", samples values between the min and max across each dimension.
    * "random_gaussian" or "gaussian", samples values from a gaussian with the same mean and std as each data's
    dimension.
    * "random_choice" or "choice", samples random examples from the data without replacement.
    * "central_dissimilar_medoids", sample the first medoid as the most central point of the dataset, then sample all
    successive medoids as the most dissimilar to all medoids that have already been picked.
    * "central_dissimilar_random_medoids", same as "central_dissimilar_medoids", but the first medoid is sampled
    randomly.
    :param empty_clusters_method: Method used at each iteration to handle empty clusters. Can take one of the following
    values :
    * "nothing", do absolutely nothing and ignore empty clusters.
    * "random_example", assign a random example to all empty clusters.
    * "furthest_example_from_its_centroid", assign the furthest example from its centroid to each empty cluster.
    :param centroids: Initials centroids to use instead of randomly initialize them.
    :param progress_bar: If `False`, disable the progress bar.
    :return: A tuple containing :
    * The memberships matrix.
    * The centroids matrix.
    * An array with all losses at each iteration.
