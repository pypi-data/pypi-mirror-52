Description: 
        ComicTagger is a multi-platform app for writing metadata to digital comics, written in Python and PyQt.
        
        Features:
        
        * Runs on Mac OSX, Microsoft Windows, and Linux systems
        * Communicates with an online database (Comic Vine) for acquiring metadata
        * Uses image processing to automatically match a given archive with the correct issue data
        * Batch processing in the GUI for tagging hundreds or more comics at a time
        * Reads and writes multiple tagging schemes ( ComicBookLover and ComicRack).
        * Reads and writes RAR and Zip archives (external tools needed for writing RAR)
        * Command line interface (CLI) on all platforms (including Windows), which supports batch operations, and which can be used in native scripts for complex operations.
        * Can run without PyQt5 installed
